To Faunus
LOVER of the Nymphs that ssee thee, Faun,

109

Bless‚ walking thro· my farm, each sunny dell,

And ere thy kindly presence be withdrawn
Blaes yeanling ssocks as well.

For thee each year shall bleed a tendet kid;
From Venus' mate, the bowl, shall deeply ssow
Libations: and my ancient altar mid
Thick odorous fumoe shall glow.

When come again December’s Nonae to thee,
The cattle gambol o'er the grassy soil:

ν The festive hamlet sports upon the lea

with oxen freed from toil;

The wolvae mid fearlaes lambkins saunter round;
For thee the treae their woodland foliage shed;
ln triple time upon the hated ground
’Πιε ditcher's dance is led.
