The Death of Cleopatra

OW drain the genial bowl, my matos,
Now strike the earth with gyvelaes feet,
Now heap the couch with Sanan catae
That gods may have their honors meet.

Ere this it were a crime to tap
The Caecuban our grandsirae stored.
While yet the Queen intrigued to sap
The Capitol and with her horde

Subvert the empire. She among
Her base, vile pack hopes rashly he1d
By Fortune's sweets to rnadnoess stung:
‘But soon her ardor was dispelled

When scarce one ship the ssarnae aecaped,
And Caoear banished from her mind
Fears Mareotic wine had shaped‚
But truer terrors left behind

When from our land each bending oar
He strained in hot pursuit—as hawk

Seek5 dovae or hunter skims the frore
Haemonian fields the hare to stan<—

To lead in chains that fatal paet.

Nobly to die she rather planned,
Cringed not at dagges, no, nor ptest

ln her swift prores to some far strand.

Her prostrate panaces she viewed

With gaze serene: the dead!y asp.
Until her body was imbued

With venom black. she dared to grasp
