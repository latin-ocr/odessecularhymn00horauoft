BOOK FOUR

ix
To Lollius

ΗΙΝΚ not my songs will e'er be mute,
Which, born where Aufidus around
Reechoes, to the according lute
l sing with arts but lately found.

Maeonian Homer sits most high,

But grave Stesichorus stands near,
While Pindar and the Cean vie

With fierce Alcaeus' utterance clear.-

Time has not blotted out as yet
The blithaeome strains Anacreon played;
Still breathe the love and warm regret
Awakened by the Laebian Maid.

Not only Spartan Helen glowed
To see a leman's glossy hair,

His robe with golden spanglae sewed,
His retinue and princely air.

Not Teucer from Cydonian bow
Shot arrows first: nor Troy was stormed

But once; not only 'gainst the foe
Idomeneus and Sthenelus swarmed

ln battlae worth the Muses’ meed:

His arm not first bold Hector braced‚
Nor stem Deiphobus dared bleed

For love of child and consort chaste.

Ere Agamemnon men of might
Were born, a host; but all, unknown,
Unwept, lie plunged in endless night,

Since no blaet bard their worth has shown.
