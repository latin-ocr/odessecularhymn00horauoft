BOOK ONE

xvii
To Tyndaris

wlf-‘r from Lycaeus Faun retreats
On fair Lucretilis to stray,
And from my goats the summer heats
And rainy winds he drives away.

These partners of a fetid spouse
Thro' arbute grove and thymy brake
May roam at large and safely browse;
My kidlets fear nor virid snake

Nor wolvae of Mars, my Tyndaris,
When Faun his tuneful syrinx sounds
Until from vale and precipice
Ustica’s echoed strain rebounds.

God lovae my muse and blameless life,
God shields me well: here Plenty pours

From brimming horn, with bountiae rife‚
For thee her most abundant stores

Shun Sirian heats in quaetered dale
And carol to the Teian chord
Penelope and Circe frail,
Both lovelom for the selisame lord.

Here 'neath my arbor's shade with me

Mild cups of Lesbian shalt thou drink:
Thyoneus. son of Semele,

And Mars shall harm us not: ne’er shrink

Laet Cyrus, under jealous straes.
With hands profane should rudely dare
Maltreat thy weaknaes, rend thy dress,
And strip the crownal from thy hair.
