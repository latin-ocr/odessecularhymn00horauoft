To Melpomene
ΙΜ, O Melpomene. whom thou

Hast looked upon at birth with placid brow‚

ln Isthmian strife the boxer's meed
shall ne'er ennoble, him no flery steed

811311 in Achaean chariot bear

A victor, strenuous toils of battle ne'er
Shall lead him up the Sacred Way.
A captain crowned with sprigs of Delian bay,

For quashing swelling threats of kings:
But fertile Tibur's murmurous-ssowing springs

And grows, with leafage thick and long,
811311 make him famous for Aeolian song.

Rome, queenlioet city of the earth,
Enrolls me now. acknowledging my worth,
Among her poets' honored choirs‚
And Envy ‘gainst me seidorn now conspires.

Pierian Maid, who rulest well
Tne dulcet warbling 01 the golden shell‚
Who, if it please thee, cygnet·s strain
Canst give to voiceless fishae 01 the main,

Such are my gifts‚ derived from thee.
Tha, pointed out for passers-by to see,
1 stand Rome's bard 01 verse divine:
Both voice and charm. 11 charm 1 have, are thine.
