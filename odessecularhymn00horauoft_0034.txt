10 THE ODES ΟΡ HORACE

V

To Pyrrha

HAT stripling boy, with fragrant dews besment,
Clasps thee mid many a rose in pleasant grot?
For whom, O Pyrrha, art thou bent
Thy yellow tresses now to knot

ln studied artlessness? How oft, alackl
Will he deplore changed saith and gods untrue,
And, while downswoop the tempests black,
The roughened seas appalled will view,

Who now, bewitched beneath thy golden spen,
Hopes thee for aye his own, lovely for aye,
Unweeting of the stormwind fell

So soon to blow! Most wretched they

Who trust, unproved, thy dazzling lovelinoes!
I know; yon sacred wall my picture keeps
ln witness that my brine-soaked dress

ls vowed to Hirn who rulae the deeps.
