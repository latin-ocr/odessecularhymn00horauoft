To Sallustius Crispus

ALLUSTlUS CRISPUS, foe to bullion dross
Unlaes thro’ moderate use it win its sheen,
Silver, while buried in earth’s sordid foss,
ls valueless and mean.

Α lengthy span shall Proculeius live
For love paterna} to his brethren shown:
To him shall Fame, stronged-winged and deathless, give
An honor his alone.

More wide thy sway, if avarice be supprest,
Than if each Carthage bowed beneath thy yoke,
And thine were Gades in the distant waet
Added to Lybia's folk.

From sels-indulgence direful dropsy spreads:
Thirst rages while the cause whence illness came
Flows thro' the veins, and watery languor sheds
A pallor o'er the frame.

Discernment differs from the rabble herde,
Bids mobs from fine misleading terms restam,
Rulae from the blest Phraates tho· restored
To Cyrus· throne he reign:

Freely baetows the diadem, the bay,
And sovereignty on him and only him
Whose eye can look on treasure's vast display
And ne’er with greed grow dim.
