To Pollio

HE clvil strife whose rising force
Datae from Metellus' consulship,
Τὴε war's mistakae‚ its plans, its source,
The sleights of Fortune, arms that drip

With blood unexpiated yet.

And chiefs colleagued — behold thy themel
A parlous taskl Thy step is set

On slag that crusts the lava's gleam.

Thy Tragic Muse in solemn stole
May quit the stage awhile: first pen
Thine annals and then play thy role
ln Cecrops· buskin once again.

Pollio, famed prop when senat& weigh
Tneir counsels, when defendants sigh,
Th0u leader whom Dalmatia’s bay
Has dowered with fame that cannot die.

E'en now my ears are stunned by blast
Of strident homs, now clarions blare,

Now steeds with riders gallop past,
Both wildered by the weapons’ glare.

Now of great chiefs 1 seem to leam,
With no inglorious dust imbrued‚

The mighty earth and all in turn,
Save Cato's stubborn soul‚ subdued.
