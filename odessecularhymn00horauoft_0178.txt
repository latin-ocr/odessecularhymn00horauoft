THE ODES OF HORACE

XV

I n Praise of Augustus

IEGES and wars 1 wished to sing,
But Phoebus smote his lyre amain
To warn lest scanty sails l ssing
O'er Tyrrhene seas. Caesar, thy reign

Back to our fields rich crops has borne,

Back to Jove's shrine our ssags has brought,
From Parthians' gorgeous ternples torn,

Has closed, since warfare shrunk to naught‚

Quirinian Janus' gate, has urged
ΒοΙά license to regain the track

Of law and order, guilt has scourged‚
And brought the ancient virtues back

Thro' which Italian farne and strength
And Latian power have widely grown,
Until our sway extends at length
To dayspring e'en frorn Haeper's throne.

While Caesar rules,¹ no civil strife
Or violence shall rnar our peace,
And passion, wont to forge the knife
And broil our haplaes towns, shall cease.

Not they that drink deep Danube’s tide
Shall break the Julian edicts' rede,

Not they by Tanais' stream that bide,
Nor Serian, Gete, nor faithless Mede.

And we on feast and working day,
While jocund Liber's gifts are ours,
First with our babes and wives shall pray
With reverence to the heavenly powers,
