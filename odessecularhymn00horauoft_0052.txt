28 THE ODES OF HORACE

xx
To Maecenas

HEAP Sabine, served in common mugs, my board
Dispenses‚ wine that by myself was sealed
ln Grecian jar, what time the theater roared .
And with such shouting pealed,

Dear knight Maecenas, that thy plaudits rung
From thy paterna! river's banks, and then

Mount Vatican's vivacious echo flung
Thy praises back again.

Caecubum's vat for thee its must distills‚
For thee the lush Calenian grape is ptest,
But nor Falernian vines nor Formian hills
Add to my cups their zest.
