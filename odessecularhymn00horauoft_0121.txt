BOOK THREE

VIII

To Maecenas

BACHELOR, March Kalends see me fill
My thurible with lucense. pluck bouquets,
And heap the living turf with coals, but still
Thou standaet ln amaze,

Tho' in the lore of both our tongues well read.
Α toothsome feast and snowy goat in see
To Liber erst I vowed, when nearly sped
By blow of falling tree.

Each rolling year this day with mirth and joke
Shall draw the pitch-smeared cork from out the lip
Of nagon set to mellow mid the smoke
ln Tullus' consulship.

Drink, dear Maecenas, to thy friend’s escape
Α hundred toasts: till morning’s sunbeams fall
Let watchful craesets ssare; far hence the shape
of strife and angry brawll

No longer worry over weal of state.
The force of Dacian Cotiso is quelled;
The noxious Medes, embroiled at home of late,
In morta! feuds are held:

The Cantabri upon the Spanish coast,
Our ancient foes, late settered‚ humbly bow;
Within their steppes the Scyths withdraw their host
And slacl( their bowstrings now.

Reck not tho' danger o'er the city lower:
Lay public care aside with all its stings;
Enjoy the blaesings of the present hour
And drop all weightier things.
