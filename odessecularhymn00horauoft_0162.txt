THE ODES OF HORACE

“Tho’ gashed, not stronger Hydra grew
When Hercules disdained defeat,
No greater marvel Colchis knew,
Or Thebes, Echion's sceptered seat.

“Plunged in the deep, more fair it glows;
When wrestled with, its pride prevails,
Altho’ till then unqueued its foes,
And wages wars for old wives’ tales.

“No more to Carthage may 1 send
Proud couriers: hope has ssed, has ssed:
Successes on our name attend
No more, since Hasdrubal is dead.”

From naught the Claudiam hands will shrink,
For Jove assists with favoring power:

wise counsels snatch them from the brink
When war's acutest crises lower.
