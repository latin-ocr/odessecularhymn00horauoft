140 THE ODES OF HORACE

Each swain his vines to widowed elm trees marries,
And moils till sunset on his hillside tilth,
Then cheerly seeks his cups and, mid-meai, tarries
To pledge thee o’er the spilth.

Thee with pure wine from goblets poured as master
He worships, thee with prayer he hails, and sees
Thy godhead 'midst his Lars, as Greece graced Castor

And stalwart Hercules.

“Long be Haeoeria's feasts‚ of thy bestowing,
Good chief 1” we shout to greet the day begun
ln sober mood. we shout with bumpers glowing
When ocean hides the sun.
