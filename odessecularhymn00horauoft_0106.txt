THE ODES OF HORACE

The man who seeks but just enough
Recks not tumultuous storms arnid
The ocean, nor Arcturus rough
At setting‚ nor the rising Kid,

Nor vines by hailstones beaten down,
Nor farm grown faithless, tho' the trees

Chide now the rains, now winter’s frown,
Now planets dire that parch the leas.

ln straitened seas the fishes glide
Since rubble chokes the deep; there toil
Contractors with their workrnen tried,
And, too, their iord, who scorns the soil,

To lay foundations. Threats and Fears
To dog the rich man urge their pace,
Black Care the bronze-beaked trireme steers,
And hounds the horseman in the chase.

Since grief yields not to Phrygian stone,
Nor purples than a star more fair,
Nor vintage, tho' Falernum's own,
Nor Achaemenian spikenard rare,

Why, envied, should 1 seek regale
1n new halis reared at much expense?
Why should Ι truck my Sabine dale
For scenes of onerous opulence?
