THE ODES OF HORACE

xm
To Lydia

HEN thou, O Lydia, sing’st the charms
Of Telephus' pink neck, the waxen arms
Of Telephus, oh fiel my soul -
With jealous spleen is goaded past control.

Strong ssaws of passion rael< my mind,
My sseeting color leavae no trace behind,

My cheeks, distained with furtive tears,
Prove how the secret fure my vitais sears.

1 blaze with wrath when made to know
His drunken brawling mars thy shoulders' snow‚
Or that, to frenzy as he slips,
His teeth leave telltale marks upon thy lips.

Nay, hearken. thou wilt surely lose

His faithless love who roughly dares to bruise
Those dulcet lips, by Venus stained

with quintessential nectar she has strained.

O trebly happy they and more

Whom ties unbroken hold, who ne'er deplore
Domoetic strife and jarring fray,

But love tin parted by the final day!
