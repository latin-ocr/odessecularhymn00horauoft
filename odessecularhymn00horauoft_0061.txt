BOOK ONE 37

But, sallon grudge thou not a sseck of shifting sand to throw
Upon my naked bones and weltering head.

So shall it hap when Eurus churns the rough Hesperian
venuzff'woods before the mast shan ree1

While thou shalt snugly lie: for thee a rich reward 1 crave‚
Corne from what port it may. and may thy keel

Be loved of :Jove and Neptune, lord of blaet Tarentum's
Wilthte'hgfl? then, venture to commit a wrong

Which may ‘hereafter to thy guiltless children bring its
Ρετὴξὲξῗίῗε justice and requital strong

Awaitff thyself. Abandoned now, for vengeance l shall pray3
Naught frorn my cursae shall avert their force:

Give heed, whate'er thine urgence‚ for l ask no long delay;
Thrice scatter sand, then lask along thy course.
