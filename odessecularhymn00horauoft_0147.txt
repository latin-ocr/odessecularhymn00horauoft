To Lyde
OW better Neptune's faetal day

Can l observe? Quick, Lyde, bream, 1 pray.

The Caecuban that mellowed long.
And leaguer wisdom hemmed with bastions strong.

The westering sun daeeends his hill,
And yet, as if the hurrying day stood still.
Thou bear'st not down the loitering cheer
That dates from Bibulus the consulâ€™s year.

To raise the ebant shall be my care
To Neptune and the Nerelds' sae-green hair,
While thou with curving shell shalt greet
Latona and the shafts of Cynthia fleet.

Next sing we her who governs Cnide
And shining Cyclades, and loves to ride

To Paphos. by linked swans conveyed:
Meet lullabiae to Night shall last be paid.
