THE ODES OF HORACE

Phoebus, his bow upon his back,
Who laves in pure Castalia's fount
His locks unshorn, and lovae to track
His Lycian groves and native mount.

Force lacking rede by its own weight
collapses: force earns due reward,

When ruled by mind. from gods who hate
Those forces bent on things abhorred.

Gyas with hundred-handed strength
Attests me, and Orion known

As Dian's tempter who at length
Was by her virgin shaft o'erthrown.

Barth, piled above them, weeps and wails
Her monstrous brood by lightning whirled
To pallid Orcus: swift fire fails
To burn thro' Aetna o'er them hurled.

Î‘ guard to Tityos assigned,
The vulture tears his liver lewd.
And thrice a hundred fetters bind
Pirithous who basely wooed.
