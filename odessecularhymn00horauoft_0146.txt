122 THE ODES OF HORACE

“‘Or, if rocks sharp with doom and crags of ssint
Entiee. corne. cast thee mid the tempaet's shock‚
Else, as a bondmaid, thou must card thy stint
And. tho· of roya1 stock,

“‘Must serve some foreign dame and live defiled
As concubine.'” To her, with sorrow stung.
Came archly-smiling Venus and her child
Bearing his bow unstrung.

The goddess first indulged in laughter: “Leave.''

Quoth she. “all bootIaes wrath and withering scorn:

This bull again shall come to bid thee cleave
And tear each hated horn.

“As puissant Jove's dear consort know thy worth. .
Give o'er thy sobs‚ thy great good fortune own.
And proudly wear it: half the spacious earth
Shall by thy name be known.''
