THE ODES OF HORACE

xx
To Maecenas

N neither weak nor vulgar wing
Shall 1 be borne thro' liquid air
A two-formed bard, nor shall 1 cling
To earth, but, proof 'gainst envy, fare

From towns. Not l, the lowly-born,
Not Ι, thine intimate, shall die,

Maecenas dear, and dwell forlorn
Where melancholy Styx flows by.

E’en now rough scales invest each shin‚
le frame a bird’s white form assumes
Above, and back and arms begin
To be arrayed in ssuffy plumes.

A tuneful swan, on safer vanes
Than Icarus', 1 soon shall soar
O'er Lybian deserts, Arctic plains¹

And Bosporus’ tumultuous shore.

Colchian and Goth that masks his dread
Of Marsian troops my spell shall own:

Far Scyths shall know me, scholars bred
ln Spain, and he that drinks the Rhone.

Around my empty bier suppress
Unseemly grief, the moan, the dirge;
Give o'er the final call; no less
A tomb’s vain honors cease to urge.
