THE ODES OF HORACE

Χιν
To Postumus

H, Postumus, my Postumus,
Fast glide the years, nor pious breath
Wards wrinkles and old age from us,
Nor yet indomitable death:

No, friend, tho' thrice a hundred kine
To tearless Pluto daily bled,

Whose ambient, gruesome waves confine,
Vast Geryon, the triple dread,

And Tityos-the waves that all
Whom bounteous earth provides with food
Must voyage o'er nor hope recall,
Tho' men of wealth, tho' delvers rude.

ln vain from gory Mars we shrink,
And booming Hadria's choppy surge. “
ln vain thro' autumn days we think
To shield our frames from Auster's scourge;

For we must see Cocytus coil
His sluggish current dari< and dun,
Curst Danaids. and the endless toil
Of Sisyphus, rough Aeolus' son.

Thou soon must leave earth, winsorne wife,
And home, while cypresses abhorred,

“ Of trees that know thy pruning knife,

Alone will mourn their short-lived lord.

Thy worthier heir the wine will pour,
Now guarded with a hundred keys‚
And prouder juice shall tinge thy ssoor
Than that the pontis-f's supper sees.
