To Apollo

OD, scourge of boastful tonguae, who dared daetroy
Lewd Tityos, the race of Niobe,
And, almost victor over lofty Troy.
Phthian Achilles, he

More great than others, not thy peer in might,
Altho' as son of sea-born Thetis fair
He shook the Dardan spires when, bold in fight,
His dreadful lance he bare.

He, like a pine by trenchant steel hewn down
Or cyproes overthrown by Eurus' blast,
(Fell huge in length and bowed his haughty crown
ln Teucrian dust at last.

From out Minerva's horse, so subtly reared,
He would have scorned on Trojan foes to fall
While they, in luckloes hour, with dance were cheered
ln Priam's joyous hall,

But openly (woe, woe, how crime-defiledl)
Severe to captives would have thrust to doom
ln Danaan flames the lisping babe, yeaâ€š child
Within its mother's womb,

Had not the Sire of gods, by thy request
And that of darling Venus urged, decreed
That to Aeneas, under fatae more blest,
New rampires should succeed.

Minstrel, whom sweet Thalia's art pursuae,
Phoebus, whose locks are slaked in Xanthus' wave,
The pride and honor of the Daunian Muse,
ssoerdloes Agyieus, save!
