118 THE ODES OF HORACE

XXV

A Dithyramb

HERE, Bacchus, wilt thou rush me. then,
Replete with thee? What grovoe or caverned glen
will shelter me, to frenzy stirred?
From what wild grotto shass my songs be heard,

whence Caesar's deathlaes name shall rise.
Glorious mid stars and senate of the skiae?

Themes worthy, new, are those 1 seek,
By other lips unsung. As from some peak ·

The sleepless Eviad in amaze

O'er Thracia, white with show, extends her gaze,
O'er Rhodope, where stranger feet

Have trodden‚ and o'er Hebrus, so 'tis sweet

To me to view, while wandering awed,

The streamlet’s marge and empty grove. O lord
Of Naiads and of Bacchic bands,

Strong to uproot tall ash trees with their hands,

No mortal strain is mine, nor slight,

Nor humbly trilled. Tho· danger, 'tis delight,
Lenaeus, in thy steps to tread,

The vlne’s green tendrils wreathed about my head.
