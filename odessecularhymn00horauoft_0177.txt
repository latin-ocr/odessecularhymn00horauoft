BOOK FOUR

So Claudius, with raeistlaes brunt,
Whelmed mailed barbarian battle line,
And, scatheless victor. rear and front

Mowed down and stretched on earth supine,

Since 'twas thy troops. thy plans that coped
With them. thy gods. lt so befalls

That suppliant Alexandria oped
To thee her port and empty halls

This very day fifteen years past.
Kind Fortune now gives prosperous end
To war, campaigns are closed at last,
And glories on thy name attend.

Thee Cantabri, unquelled till now,
lndian, nomadic Scyth, and Mede
Admire, for potent lord art thou
Of queenly Rome and Latium's breed.

Thee Nile, that hides his fountains’ source,
Thee Tigris swift and Ister's wave,

Thee monstrous seas whose breakers hoarse
Around the distant Britons rave,

Thee Gaul, unawed tho' death should merce,
And harsh lberia's land, obey;

And, slaughter-crazed. Sygambri fierce
Lay down their arms and own thy sway.
