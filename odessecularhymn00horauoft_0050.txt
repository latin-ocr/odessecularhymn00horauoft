26 THE ODES OF HORACE

xvi 11
To Varus

O tree before the sacred vine to thee for planting calls,

Either in Tibur’s mellow loam or near Catilius' walis,
O Varus: sad the life of them whom God denies its use,
Whose biting sorrows never ssed before the genia! juice.
Who harps on poverty or hard campaigns when warm with
Who εἴτιςῃξῗηοῖ thee, then, Venus fair, thee, Bacchus, sire
Yet, lesbtergggges come when temperate Liber's gifts are rife,
The Centaurs warn us in theIr cups with Lapithae at strife‚'
And warn us, too, the Sithoni, whom Evius oft embroils
When, muddling right and wrong, they lie enmaehed in
O youtlhlfsffluhacs'ssreu& 1 rouse thee not against thy will,
Nor drag to light thy mysteriae with pied leaves hidden stin:
Hush thou the savage kettledrum and Berecyntian horn,
Behind which, holding far too high her empty head, trails
And ὃῗὶᾷὲἵιτίθςε, with blinded eyes, and, ever prompt to
At keegffig secrets, Faithlaesneae, her wiles than glass more

clear.
