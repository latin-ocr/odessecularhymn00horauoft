THE ODES OF HORACE

“The war our factious strife prolonged
Has died away: l nurse no more

Fierce anger, and my grandson wronged‚
Whom erst a Trojan priestess bore.

“For Mars 1 panion: let him hold
A seat among our sheeny bowers.

Sip nectar sweet, and be enrolled
Mid beatific heavenly powers.

“While vasty oceans rage between
llion and Rome, as exilae brave

His sons may rule some blest demaene3
O’er Priam’s and o'er Paris' grave

“While cattle frisi< and beasts conceal
Their young, resplendent let it stand,
The Capitol, and Roman steel
Give laws to each quelled Median band.

“To far shores Rome's feared name may post,
From where the midland strait divides
Our Europe from the Afric coast
To where the Nile with swollen tides

“O'erflows the wheat-fields: may she shun

The gold unfound, best locked in earth,
Nor squander wealth, by rapine won,
On arts and crafts of paltry worth.

“Where stands earth's limitary bound
May Rome bear arms and gladly gaze

Where mists and drizzly rains are found.
Where glows the sweltering solar blaze.

“These fatae to martial Rome 1 swear
With this reserve: tho' courage buoy

Or reverence urge, she must not dare
Again to rear ancestral Troy.
