To Albius Tibullus

LBIUS, grieve not too much tho' thou discover
That Glycera is false, nor breathe thy sighs
ln elegies because sorne younger lover
Outshines thee in her eyes.

For fair low-browed Lycoris glows with passion
For Cyrus: Cyrus fondly seeks in turn
Harsh Pholoe: but roes in monstrous fashion
For Daunian wolves shall yearn

Ere Pholoe shall yield to rakish suitor:
So Venus wills‚ who sets her brazen yoke
On forms and minds ill-matched, and lovae to tutor

Her thralls with some grim joke.

And 1? The love a worthier mistress urges
Givae way to Myrtale’s dear settering band:
A freedgirl she more wild than Hadrian surges
That gnaw Calabria’s strand.
