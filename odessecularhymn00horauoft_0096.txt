THE ODES OF HORACE

XVll

To Maecenas

HY must these tiresome bodings be?
Earlier for thee in death to wend
Suits not, Maecenas, gods nor me,
My fortune's prop, my worthiest friend.

Of thee, rny soul's baet part, bereft,
Shall 1, the other half, delay,

With all ties gone and nothing left
Save cheerless life? That fatal day

Shall wreck us both. No idle vow
1 utter: we shall go, shall go,
Whene'er thou journey, 1 and thou,
Companions on the road below.

Tho' rose Chimera belching firae,
Or Gyas with his hundred hands,
'Twould part us not: so Fate requires.
And powerful Justice so commands.

Tho· Libra ruled when 1 was born.
Tho’ baleful Scorpio held his reign
With aspect fell, or capricorn,
The tyrant of the western main,

Our horoscopes in wondrous style

Agree. Thee Jove, thy guardian blaet,
Rescued from Saturn’s wicked wile,

And brought death’s rapid wings to rest

When from the theater densely filled
Thy glad ovation thrice outbroke;
Ι, badly stunned, was all but killed
When fell the tree, but Faun the stroke
