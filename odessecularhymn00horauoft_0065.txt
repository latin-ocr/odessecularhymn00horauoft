To my Lyre

HEY call me. Π 1 idly ’neath the shade
With thee trolled strains to live the whole year long,
Yea, all the years, come, be my touch obeyed,
And yield a Latian song,

Th0u lyre whom erst the Lesbian patriot knew,
Who, bold in war, yet when the fight waxed sore.
Or when his stom-tost ship he safely drew
Upon the spray-drenched shore,

Stin sang of Liber and the Musae fair,
Of Venus with her fondly-clinging child,
And Lycus handsome with his jetty hair
And jetty glauces mild.

Ο ornament of Phoebus, pleasing shell,
Whene'er 1 duly hail thee, be thou near,
For, loved at Jove's high feast, thy soothing swell
Bids sorrow disappear.
