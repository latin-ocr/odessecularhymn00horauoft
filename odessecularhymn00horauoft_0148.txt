THE ODES OF HORACE

XXIX

To Maecenas

CION of kingliest Tyrrhene stocks,
Α virgin jar of mellow juice,
Roses. and baisam for thy locks,
1 long have treasured for thy use,

Maecenas. Haste thee: seek a change
From Aefula's sloped uplands wide,
Moist Tibur, and the hilly range
Of Telegon the parricide.

Forsake the elegance that cloys
Within thy cloud-aspiring dorne,

Admire no more the smoke, the noise,
And opulence of wealthy Rome.

Change to the rich man oft brings rest:
The poor man's roof and frugal fare,
Tho' purple hangings lend no zest,
Have smoothed the furrowed front of care.

Andromeda's bright sire now shows
His hidden sire, now Procyon burns,
The star of furious Leo glows
As summer's scorching heat returns.

Tired shepherds with their drooping sheep
Now seek rough Silvan's eopse, the pool,
And shade‚ while, hushed in silence deep,

v The banks are rest of breezes cool.

Yet State and Town still tax thy braim
Thine anxious thoughts are bent to scan
What Bactra, Cyrus' old domam,
Seres, and factious Scythians plan.
