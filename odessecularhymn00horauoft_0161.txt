BOOK FOUR

From brave and good are born the brave:
Both steers and steeds their sires’ physique
lnherit; eagles fierce ne'er gave
Their being to the stockdoves meek.

But training innate worth improves‚

And righteousness makes hearts more strong:
When high morality removes,

E’en men of birth are dimmed ere long.

What, Rome, thou ow'st the Neros, erst
Was proved by Hasdrubal's cold clay,

Metaurus' stream, and gloom dispersed
From Latium on that glorious day,

The first triumphantly to shine
Since thro’ ltalia’s citied plain
Swept Afric's flend, like fire thro' pine
Or Eurus o'er Siciiia’s main.

The Roman youth thereafter toiled

’Neath Fortune's smiie, and temples then,
By impious Punic foes despoiled‚

Beheid their gods set up again,

Tin faithless Hannibal begun:

“Mere hinds, doomed ravening wolves to seed,

We harass whom to dupe and shun
Were in itself illustrious deed.

“A race that, brave from llion's (lame,
Brought home-gods, sons, and fathers hoar,
Tin, tost by Tuscan seas‚ they came
To citiae on Ausonia’s shore,

“Like oak trees, lopped by heavy ax
When Algidus· dark forests reei,
Daepite their loss and wounds, they wax
ln vigor from the very steei.
