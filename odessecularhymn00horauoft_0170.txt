146 THE ODES OF HORACE

Small odds betwixt desert unhymned
And baseness in the tomb! My page

Shall, Lollius, never leave thee dimmed,
Nor let oblivion's envious rage

Unpunished gnaw each glorious feat.
A soul is thine in action wise,
Upright when prosperous seasons sseet
And when more doubtful times arise.

Avenger on purloining thies,

And proof 'gainst all-absorbing gold,
And consul. not a one-year-chief,

But oft as judgment true and bold

Expedience to the right subdues‚

Waivffi bad men’s bribes with haughty glance‚·
And thro· reform's obstructing crews

Beholds its conquering arms advance.

Not truly blest we can the man
Of vast possessions: blest is he,
And truly so, whose wiser plan
Enjoys what goods the gods decree,

To pinching want who cheerly bends‚
And fears disgrace as worse than death:

Such man for home and cherished friends
Stands ready to raeign his breath.
