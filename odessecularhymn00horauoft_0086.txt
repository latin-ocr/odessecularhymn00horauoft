THE ODES OF HORACE

lx
To Valgius

OT always from the storrn cloud falls
The shower upon the sodden plain,
Not ever rise the gusty squalls
To grapple with the Caspian main,

Friend Valgius, nor Armenia's shore

The twelvernonth thro‘ is stiff with frost,
Garganian oaks dread Boreas' roar

Not aye, nor ash weeps foliage lost.

But still the burden of thy teen

ls Mystae dead: thou art not done
When Vesper's rising ray is seen,

Or when he flees the circling sun.

He who saw three daecents expire
Lived not thro' all his years forlorn
For loved Antilochus: his sire
And Phrygian sisters ceased to mourn

Young Troilus at last. Baehrew
Thy weak complainingsl Sing we now
Augustus Caaear’s trophiae new,
Niphates stark, the folk that bow

Where old Euphratae’ tides advance
Their humbled currents thro’ the mead‚
Gelonian tribffi that tamely prance,
Nor dare their narrowed bounds exceed.
