To Torquatus

OW ssed are the snows and the grass clothes the mead‚
The trees are renewing their frondage,
Earth's seasons are changed. and the shrunken streams speed
Past banks that now keep them in bondage.

The Grace with twain sisters and Nymphs from their bower
Dares, nude, to tread featly a measure.

“Hope not deathlaes life,'' warn the year and the hour

Tmt fleets on the day fraught with pleasure.

The frosts yield to zephyr, then routed is spring
By summer, whose death will be early,

Δ For fruit-laden fall soon its hawaets will fling:

Last, winter comes, sluggish and surly.

Swift moons repair quickly their loss in the sides,
But we, when we once have doecended

To Ancus, rich Tullus, Aeneas the wise,
With shadow and ashes are blended.

Who knows if the gods to the sum of to-day
Have planned to apportion to·morrow?

Thy wealth from thine heir's greedy hand wouldst thou stay?
From self, for thy much-loved soul, borrow.

When once thou art dead and a glorious doom
By Minos has been pronounced o'er thee,
Birth, goodness, nor eloquence out from the tomb.

Torquatus, will ever raetore thee.

For Dian herself could not free from hell's reign
Hippolytus chaste when he perished,

And Theseus could sunder not Lethe's strict chain
From limbs of Pirithous cherished.
