BOOK Two 59

v1
To Septimius

EP‘slMlUs, who for love wouldst go with me
To Gadae and where Cantabri rebel,
And cruel Syrtes where the Moorish sea
Seethes with its ceaseless swell;

May Tibur, by the Argive settler reared,
Become my horne when near the close of life,
Becorne my refuge frorn the hardships feared
By sea, by land, by strifel

Whence, if the dour Fatae bar me out betimae,
Meads by Galaeus' stream will 1 invade,
Most sweet to skin-clad ewae, and those fair clim&
Spartan Philanthus swayed.

That spot charms more than all the rest of earth;
No clearer honey can Hymettus yield,
No olive ever grew of goodlier worth
ln green Venafrum's field.

There Jove vouchsafes mild winters, 1ingering springs,
There. dear to fruitful Bacchus, Aulon shapae
Τὴε clusters fair, and feels no jealous stings
For sweet Falernian grapae.

That sunny n00k‚ those heights that know no storm,
Call thee and me: there shalt thou, at the end.
Bedew with votive tears the ashae warrn
of me, thy poet-friend.
