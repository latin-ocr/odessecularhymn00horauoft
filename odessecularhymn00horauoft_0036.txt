To Plancus

ET others sing of Ephesus or Mytilene's lure,
Famed Rhodes, or walls of Corinth 'twixt two seas,
Or Bacchic Thebes, or Delphi where Apollo's word is sure,
Or Tempe shady with Thessalian trees.

There are whose only task it is to rhapsodize the town
Of virgin Pallas with an epic song,

And thus with olive garnered far and wide their brows they
In ,Ιιειξιῖζῃὶιοηοτ many yet will long

To sing horse-pasturing Argos and Mycenae rich in gold.
Me sturdy Sparta not so much imprest,

Nor yet Larissa's fruitful glebe my fancy so could hold,
As deep Albunea's cave where never raet

The echoes, tumbling Anio’s stream, and old Tiburnus'
Αηάζῖἰῗιειτᾶε watered by meandering rills.

As Notus often clears the sky, when clouds the welkin hood,
Nor sluicy rains incessantly distills,

So, Plancus, soothed with mellow wine, strive wisely to
The fggffgws and the weary toils of life,

And this, too, whether Tibur's umbrose woodlands hold thee
Or, ἔξω with ensigns gay, the camp of strife.

Despite his grief, his templae bathed with wine.

Then, as a wreath of poplar leaves he wove about his head,
His downcast friends bespoke in words benign:
