To Venus

LATELY lived in fighting trim,
Not without glou-y my campaigns:
Now lute is war-worn, arms are dim,
And thaee, where sea-born Venus reigns‚

Must hang upon her leftward wall.

Here, here be naming flambeaus placed,
with bows and levers, too, for al!

Have barricaded doorways faced.

O queen of Cyprus· blissful seat,

And Memphis, free from Thracian snow,

Goddoes. with lash uplifted boet
Proud Chloe with one single blow.
