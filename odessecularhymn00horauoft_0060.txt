HE earth, the ocean, and the countless sands that strew
Ατεὴιᾷἶεξῖιῗῖιῗυ couldst measure in thy skill;
Matinum's heach with scanty dust now sees thee covered
Andonfft’hing steads it thee that ’twas thy will,

Doomed as thou wert to die, the blest abodes to scale in
Or thlzgpgtfhte curving vault of heaven to ssy,

For Pelops' father, though the guest of gods, to death was
Τίῐὴξὲἶὲῗῗὲἓ), was wafted to the sky,

Minos, Jove’s confidant, is gone, while Tartarus enthralls
The son of Panthus, back to Hades sent,

Who proved, by taking down his target from the temple
Thagvssssi( to Trojan times his mernory went,

And that to gloomy death he yielded up but thews and skin;
He, thinkest thou, a student deeply versed

In nature’s lore. One common night each several soul will
And Zff'mugt tread the road of death accurst.

The Furies some devote to Mars, a sight to glut his rage‚
Devouring seas the mariner entomb,

The funeral trains congested stand and youth crowds hard
Grirssrssrzgsgi‘pine exempts no sou! from doom.

Me, too, oblique Orion's rnate, swift-whirling Notus, low
Beneath lllyrian wavae in death has sped:
