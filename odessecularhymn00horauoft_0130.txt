106 THE ODES OF HORACE

XVI

To Maecenas

HE brazen turret and the portals oaken
And sentry mastiffs, guards that grimly growled.
Had mured fair Danae in thrall unbroken‚
Tho’ midnight lovers prowled‚

Had not the prisoned virgin’s anxious warder‚

Acrisius, been by Jove and Venus mocked‚

For when a god with gifts became marauder,
No door could long be locked.

Gold wins its way where courtier bands assemble,
And, stronger than the levin bolt, thro' stone
lt rives a pathway; lucre caused to tremble
And sink in ruin prone

The Argive augur's house: towns· gatae were crumbled
Before the man of Macedon, who beat
His rival kings thro· bribes: bribes’ snares have humbled
Bluff admirals of the fleet.

Sorrow and thirst for greater gains are faring
Behind increasing riches; high to tower
With haughty head is past my prudent daring.
Maecenas, knighthood's flower.

So far as man shuns affluence' attraction,
So far shall heaven enrich him: 1, unclad,
Camp with the frugal and desert the faction
Of pelf, at heart right glad,

More famed a lord of wealth rnen value lightly
Than if —while crops the stout Apulian reaps
My granaries are said to garner tightly ——-
Poor amid treasured heaps.
