Τ length enough of direful hail and snow Α) “L'‘ avez-x ἱ <
The Sire has sent and, hurling lightnings down
With red right hand ’gainst Sacred Heights below.
Has terrified the Town,

Yea‚ terrified the nations¹ filled with dread
Laet Pyrrha’s time return with portents strange,
When Proteus all his herd of seals upled
On mountain peaks to range,

And fish were caught in elm limbs’ topmost height,
Where erst the doves were wont to build their home,
While here and there hinds swam in sore affright
Across the swelling foarn.

We saw the yellow 'siben strongly rolled
Back from the Etruscan shore in turbid sheets,
Upsurge to ssood the King's Memorial old
And Vesta’s templed seats,

Bragging too stoutly that he would redress
Lorn llia and, tho' Jove withheld his nod,
Presuming past his leftward bank to praes,
Uxorious river god.

Our youth, their number thinned by parent stain,
Shall hear of Romans whetting well the knife
By which dread Persians better had been slain,
Shall hear of civil strife.

What god to buttress our declining realm
Shall we implore? With what fond prayer shall throngs
Of holy virgins Vesta’s ear o'erwhelm,
Regardlaes of their songs?
