My happier portion - limpid waters welling,
My grove's scant acreage‚ a harvest sure-—
No praetor knows in fertile Afric dwelling
Mid empire's golden lure.

For me Calabrian be& distill no homey,
Nor crocks with mellowing Laaetwgonian flow,
Altho' for me where Gallie meads are sunny
No heavy fleecae grow,

Yet distant still is poverty’s dull fener:
Th0u sure wilt give if more my needs require:
1 shall increase my slender assets better
By curbing each daeire

Than if Alyattae’ kingdom l united
To Mygdon’s plains. Those seeking much lack much.
Blest he whom God with little has requited,
‘ Yet lives content with such.
