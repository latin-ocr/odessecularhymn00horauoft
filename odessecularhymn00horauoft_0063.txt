VENUS. queen of Paphos and of Cnide‚
Quit Cyprus dear and seek the temple fair
of Glycera. who calls thee to her side
With ciouds of incense rare.

May Nymphs and glowing cupid with thee wend,
bet {oosely-girdled Gracae hither throng,
Bring Youth, who lacking thee no joy can lend‚
And Mercury along.
