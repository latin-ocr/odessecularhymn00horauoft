BOOK ONE 9

To Sestius

TERN winter gives way to blithe springtide and zephyr,
Dry keels are rolled down to the shore,

The hind leaves the hearth, from the stall comae the helsen
Meads glisten with hoarfrost no more.

Lo, now, Cytherea by moonshine trips lightly
with Graces and Nymphs on the green, ’
'meir merry feet wink, heavy forgae glow brightly

When Vulcan with Cyclops is seen.

Our sleek brows now bind we with green myrtle fillet,
f Or ssowerets that burst from the plain:
To Faun now a lamb, or a kid, if he will it,
His own bosky grove shall see slainss

Pale Death knocks alike at the cot of the peasant
And halls of the wealthy. My friend,

The brief span of life bids us trust but the present:
Rich Sestius, in night must thou wend,

Mid shadowy Manes, to Pluto's drear dwelling,
No more to preside at the board‚

No more to see Lycidas, fair beyond telling.
By youths and by maidens adored.
