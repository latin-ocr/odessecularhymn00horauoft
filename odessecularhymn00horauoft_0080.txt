THE ODES OF HORACE

111
To Dellius

N trials bear a rnind serene,
And when prosperity is nigh
Let no exultant pride be seen,
Since, Dellius, thou art doomed to die,

Tho' thou the tirne in sadness pass,
Tho' thou thro' happy days recline
ln nook retired upon the grass
With jars of choice Falernian wine.

Why do tall pines and poplars white
Weave with their limbs a pleasing shade?
Why do pellucid streams take ssight
ln sinuous windings down the glade?

Send persumes here, the vintage red,
And rose whose blossorns fade too soon,
While the Three Sisters' sable thread,
Fortune, and Youth permit the boon.

Thou soon must quit thy horne, thy lands,
Thy villa yellow Tiber laves,

Quit these, and leave thine heir whose hands
ltch for the hoarded wealth he craves.

From ancient Inachus tho' born
And rich, tho' of the baser host.
Poor, shelterless‚ thou live forlorn -—
Stin ruthless Dis will claim thy ghost.

We all are mustered; soon or late
Our lots leap forth the shaken urn,
And Charon’s boat conveys us straight

To exile whence is no return.
