152 THE ODES OF HORACE

xiv
I n Praise os the Neros

ΑΝ Fathers' or Quirites' zeal
Meet tribute to thy fame engage,
Thy deeds to aftertime reveal
Thro' tablet and memorial page,

Augustus, mightiest chieftain named
Where’er the sun lights peopled shores?
Tho' long by Latian law untamed,
The stout Vindelic kern deplores

Thy prowess. For brave Drusus beat

With troops of thine a ruthless herde,
Genauni and the Brueni fleet‚

When from their Alpine keeps they poured‚

And amply paid them back their due:
The elder Nero next waged sight
Most fierce and Rhaetia's savage crew
With happy omens put to ssight.

'Twas wondrous, on the sanguine field,
To see what havoc there befell

Those hearts that died but would not yield.
As tameless Auster whips the swell

When dancing Pleiads rive the dark‚
So keen was he to smite the foe,

Urge on his snorting steed, and mark
Where hottest blazed the battle glow.

As buli-shaped Aufidus amain
Flows thro· Apulian Daunus’ realms
And, raging, ali the well-tilied plain
With desolating deiuge whelms,
