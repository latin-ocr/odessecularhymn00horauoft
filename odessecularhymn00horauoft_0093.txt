XV

Against Luxury

EW acrae for the plow to break
Our regal piles will leave: dispread
Around, more broad than Lucrine lake,
Are seen the fishponds; planae unwed

Will oust the elms; soon pansied sward.
And myrtle brake. and all sweet scents.
Where olivae for their former lord
Once teemed, will fragrant airs dispense.

Thick laurels soon a screen will form
To bar the fervid rays. Not thus

’ Of old was bearded Cato's norm,

Nor that prescribed by Romulus.

Each common’s wealth was small. but vast
The State's: then stretched no porticoae

ln far-flung pomp, where murmured past
Cool north winds thro* their columned rows.

For private use no man could slight
'The ready sod: but proudly shone

Halls and the fanae of gods. bedight.
At public eost, in new-style stone.
