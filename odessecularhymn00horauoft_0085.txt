To Barine

ARINE, were thy charms one whit the laes
ln retribution for thy perjured truth‚
Hadst thou one blemish to thy loveliness,
A blackened nail or tooth,

l might believe thee: but thy radiance rare
Draws glamour from thy violated word:
For thee alone, when tripping thro' the square,
Our giddy youth are stirred.

lt boots thee to invoke with lying breath
Thy mother's dust‚ the silent signs of night,
ffYae, heaven's expanse‚ and gods whom gelid Death
Has never power to smite.

Laughs Venus* self, methinks, when this is known,

61

Laugh the good-natured Nymphs and, filled with lre,

cupid who whets upon a gory stone
His arrows barbed with fire.

Then‚ last and worstl our growing manhood falls
Beneath thy lure: new slaves are growing, yet
The old quit not their impious mistraes' halls,
Tho· oft they vainly threat.

Thee mothers for their hulking youngsters fear,
Thee thrifty sirae, thee damsels wed but now,
In downright misery laet their husbands dear
Forsake for thee their voW.
