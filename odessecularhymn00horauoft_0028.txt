4 THE ODES OF HORACE

Makes peer of gods above: me cool, thick boughs
And lissom Nymphs with Satyrs dancing free
Distinguish from the vulgar tif for me

Euterpe deign to breathe up tn her ssute,

And Polyhymnia thrill her Laebian lute.

lf ranked by the'e mid lyric bards 1 tread,

Then will 1 strike the stars with lofty head.
