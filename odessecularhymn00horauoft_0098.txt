THE ODES OF HORACE

xv111
To a Miser

'ER my modest rooms no blended
Gold and ivory gleam confest.
No Hymettian marbles splendid
Cap tall shafts in Afric drest,

Attalus has never laden
Me with malms, his unknown heir,
In rny hails no high-born maiden
Trails Laconian purples rare.

Truth is mine and inspiration,
Me, tho' poor, the rich attend,
Never, to exalt my station,
Shall 1 tease my powerful friend

Or the gods for further gaining,
Pleased with Sabine farm most dear.

Moons that lately waxed are waning.
Day speeds day in swift career.

Marble slabs thou still art sawing.
Flouting death tho· near the grave;

Thou art building mansions‚ drawing
Out the shoreline where the wave

Beats at Baiae, still unsated,

Since the beach thy wealth confinae.
Shamel thy neighbor, desolated,

For his farmstead's bound-stones pines.

Greed thy tenants‘ fields has harried,
Man and wife are rest of horne,

Hearth-gods in their bosoms carried
Forth with ragged babes must roam.
