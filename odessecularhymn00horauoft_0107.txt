On Patriotism

HE youth inured in war's stem trade
Should study patiently to bear
Privations dire, with horseman's blade
should vex the cruel Mede, and dare

To bivouac ’neath the open skiae
Mid hard campaigns. From hostile tower
When such by ripening daughter·s eyae
And consort of the warring power

Is seen, they sigh: “Ah, ne'er engage,
Our trothplight prince, to war unbred‚

ν That lion sterce whom bloody fage

Incites to deeds of carnage dread.'’

Sweet. glorious 'tis for native land
To die. Death fossows him that ssees,
Nor sparae the youths that trembling stand,
But bruises coward loins and kneae.

True Virtue wards all base attacks
while her untarnished honors glow,
Nor drops nor reassumes the ax
As favor's fickle breezae b10w.

True Virtue dowers Desert with gift

Of heaven, she treads paths not allowed
To others. and with pinion swift

She spums dank earth and vulgar crowd.

Leal silence, too, has sure reward.
Tattlers of Cerae' mysteries dark

Shan house not ’neath my rooftree broad,
Nor shall they e'er with me embark
