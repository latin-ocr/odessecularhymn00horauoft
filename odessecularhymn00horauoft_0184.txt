160 THE ODES OF HORACE

And you, ye Parcae, faithful to narrate
Decrees once uttered — O forever last
The stablished course of things! — a future great
Weld to our glorious past.

Let golden Ceres wear a corn-spray crown
Bestowed by earth that teems with herds and fruits,
Let gales of Jove and healthful showers sent down
Nourish our tender shoots.

Gentle and mild Apollo, lay aside
Thy darts and to the suppliant youth give aid,
And, crescent Moon, the constellations' pride
And queen, assist the maid.

If truly of your handiwork be Rome
And llian exiles made the Etruscan shore,
A remnant they that, leaving town and home,
On prosperous courses bore,

Remnant for whom, unscathed thro' blazing Troy,
Surviving horne, Aeneas, pure in mind,
Paved ample passage, that they might enjoy
More fame than that behind:

Gods‚ give our earnest children moral health,
Gods, give calm age to wear a tranquil face,
And to the sons of Romulus give wealth‚
Offspring‚ and every grace.

What Venus* and Anchises' glorious child
Entreats of you, while snowy bullocks reel,
Grant ye, for first in fight is he, but mild
When vanquished foemen kneel.

The Alban ax and Rome's unconquered troops
The Mede now fears on land and on the wave,
The lndian, yea, the haughty Scyth now stoops
A friendly pact to crave.
