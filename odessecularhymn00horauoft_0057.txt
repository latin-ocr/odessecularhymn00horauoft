xxv
To Lydia

ESS oft with frequent blows loud youngsters shake
Thy casement shutters than in days of yore;

Few from thy slumbers call thee to awaRe:
Thy threshoid binds the door

That freeiy once upon its hingae swung;

Now laes and less thou hearaet lover weep:
“While thro· the livelong night my heart is wrung.
Ah, Lydia, wilt thou sieep?”

ln turn shalt thou, a slighted hag. bewaii
That roistering rakae avoid thine aney lone.
while thro' the mooniess night the Thracian gale
Makes bacchanalian mean,

While raging lust and passion·s stinging smart,
Like those that make the dams of stallions burn.
Shau glow like sire about thy cankered heart,
And sadly shalt thou {earn

That gamaeorne youth with ecstasy perceivae
Green ivy and the dusky myrtle blend‚
But dedicatas the sear and withered leavoe
To Eurus, winter’s friend.
