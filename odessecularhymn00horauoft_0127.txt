To the Fountain Bandusia

ANDUSIA'S fountain, more than crystal bright,
Worthy of mellow wine and wreaths of flowers,
For thee to-morrow l shall smite
A kid whose swelling forehead lowers

With budding homs, portending‚ tho' ln vain,
Sweet love and hames: he thy runnels cold
with crimson blood shall deeply stain,
Τὴε offspring of the wanton fold.

Thee the hot season of the Sil-ian star
Can never touch: thou to the plow-wom steer,
And to the cattle ranging far,
Dost proffer cool, refraehing cheer.

Thou shalt be reckoned mid the storied wells
When Ι have sung the ilex tree that grows
Baeide the hollow, rocky cells
Whence swift thy babbling water ssows.
