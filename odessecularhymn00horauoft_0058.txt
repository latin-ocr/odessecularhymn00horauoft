THE ODES OF HORACE

xxvl
I n Praise of Lamia

HE Muse befriends me: gloom and care,
Be buried by the tempestsâ€™ roar
ln Cretic seas: beneath the Bear

What monarch rules the frozen shore,

Or wherefore Tiridates cowers,
1 little reck. Pimplea sweet,

Nymph of pure springs, weave sunny flowers
For Lamia, weave him garlands neat.

1 cannot waft his praise abroad

Without thee. Him with new-learned strain,
Him with the Lesbian quill to laud,

Befits thee and thy sister train-
