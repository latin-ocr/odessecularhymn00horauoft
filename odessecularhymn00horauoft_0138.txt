THE ODES OF HORACE

x><1 11
To Phidyle

T new moon, rustic Phidyle,

Thine upturned palms to heaven prefer,
And to the Lars thine offering be

Fresh grain. a greedy sow, and myrrh.

So shall thy fertile vineyard sear
No hot sirocco, nor thy crop

The blighting smut, nor lambkins dear
Foul airs when ripening applae drop.

Mid oaks and holms sleek porkers seed
On Algidus where snows are rife,

Kine batten in the Alban mead,
But these must dye the pontiff's knife.

No need to weary heaven with vows
And hecatombs of full-grown beeves
lf thou but wreathe thy godlings’ brows
With mint and brittle myrtle leavae.

When altars know thy pure intent,
Tho· ne'er a costly victirn reel.

Estranged Penates shall be bent
By crackling salt and holy meal.
