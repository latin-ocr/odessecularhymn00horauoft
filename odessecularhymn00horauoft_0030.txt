THE ODES OF HORACE

To whom shall Jupiter assign the task
Of freeing us from guilt? With shoulders clear
Mantled in cloud, O come at length, we ask,
Apollo, prescient seer:

Or, laughing Erycina, if thou will,
Around whom always hover Mirth and Love:
Or, if thy slighted sons thou pity still,
Our Founder, from above,

Cloyed with thy game, too long, alas! pursued,
Pleased with the polished helms, the battle shout.
And scowl of Marsian foot, their charge renewed
The bloody foe to rout;

Or if in altered semblance, ssitting free
To earth, benignant Maia’s winged child,
Thou bear the guise of youth and deign to be
Caesar’s avenger styled:

Late to the skies be thy return deferred.
Long with Quirinus' folk be pleased to dwell,
Nor, by our heinous sins to anger stirred,
By any whirlwind fell

Be banished. Here be mighty triumphs paid,
Here be both Sire and Prince for our relies,
Nor let the foraying Medes unpunished raid
While, Caesar, thou art chief.
