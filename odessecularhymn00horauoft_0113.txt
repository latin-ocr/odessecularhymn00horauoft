BOOK THREb}

With you at hand l fain shall spread
My sail and steer amid the roar
of Bosporus, and safely tread
Hot sands on far Assyria's shore.

Concani quaffmg horses’ blood,
The Britons harsh to stranger folk,
The quivered Goth, the Scythian ssood‚
Shall l behold nor fear death’s stroke.

You cheer within Pierian grots
Great Caesar, respiting from toil‚

When settled on their landed plots
His cohorts cease from civil broil.

You, Muses sweet‚ give counsel fair
And love to give it, too. We know

How He with hurtling lightning’s glare
The impious Titan brood laid low—

He who o’er earth inert presides,

Towns, realms of death, and gusty main:

Both gods and mortal throngs he guidae
Alike with sole impartial reign.

To Jove himself came deadly fear
From crew accurst with arms of might,
From brothers twain who strove to rear
On dark Olympus Pelion's height.

But what could Rhoetus, Mimas do,
Or what Porphyrion’s mien of ire,

Enceladus who boldly threw
Uprooted trunks, Typhoeus dire,

Tho' all 'gainst Pallas' clanging shield
Together rushed? Here Vulcan burns,

There matron Juno takes the field,
From Patara and Delos turns
