142 THE ODES OF HORACE

From Phoebus came my pure poetic ᾔτεε,
From Phoebus genius and my lyric power:
So, therefore, youths, born of illustrious sirae,
And virgins, girlhood's flower,

Wards of the Delian Maid who love's to wend
With bow in chase of bucks and lynxae fleet‚
Keep time in Lesbian measure and attend
My finger’s rhythmic beat,

While duly singing dark Latona's son,
And duly Noctiluca's crescent glow,
Who speeds the headlong seasons as they run
And bids the harvests grow.

Thou, soon a bride, shalt say, “It was my part,
When dawned the Secular Festal, to rehearse
The song to gods most dear, knowing by heart
Horace the poet's verse.”
