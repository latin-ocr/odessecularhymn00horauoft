THE ODES OF HORACE

x1
To Quinctius Hirpinus

HAT warlike Cantabri may plan.
And Scyths whom barrier seas repel,
Quinctius Hirpinus, prithee, ban
As vain alarms; no further dwell

On fleeting life whose needs are few.

Fresh youth and beauty backward creep
As sapless eld bids long adieu

To frolic loves and restful sleep.

The vernal ssower that mildly beams
Must fade, the ruddy moon must wane:
Why then, unfit for endless schemes,
Wilt thou for naught fatigue thy brain?

Why drink we not, while time allows,
Stretched 'neath this pine or sycamore,

ln careless guise, our grizzled brows =
With Syrian nard besprinkled o’er ’

And wreathed with roses? Evius stills
Our carking cares. What slave of mine

Will temper from the wimpling rills “
Our cups of brisk Falernian wine?

Come, who will coax from home that jade,
The tricksy Lyde? Bid her haste

With ivory lute, like Spartan maid,
Her hair with simple knot engraced.
