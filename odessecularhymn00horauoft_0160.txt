136 THE ODES OF HORACE

ιν
I n Praise os Drusus

S lightning's winged servant whom
Jove, king of gods, o’er birds of air
Made sovereign‚ since his faithful plume
Blond Ganymede to heaven upbare, —

First, urged by youth and native strength,
Leaves venturously his aerie’s height,
And, wintry clouds dispelled at length,
On spring gales tries ambitious ssight,

Fearful at first; next, on the told
Swoops swiftly down, with power endued;
Last, writhing serpents strives to hold,
Impelled by love of fight and food:

Or like a lion, weaned of late
From tawny mother's milky breast,
Whose tooth‚ as yet unsseshed, brings fate
To roes that in rich pastures rest:

Drusus, 'neath Rhaetian Alps at war,
Such to Vindelic ciansmen seemed.
(Why, ages long, by tribal law,
The Amazonian ax has gleamed

ln their right hands, 1 never tried
To know: not all things are revealed.)
Thaee hordes that conquered far and wide,
To our wise prince now forced to yield,

Have learned the power of heart and soui
Reared round a hearth whose base is truth.
How Caesar’s fatherly control
Nurtured the Neros from their youth.
