BOOK Two

An early death laid famed Achilles low,
Tithonus withered thro· protracted eld:
On me, perhaps, will hurrying time baetow
The goods from thee withheld.

Round thee a hundred ssocks b1eat wide and far
And Sikel kine are lowing; for thy use
Τὴε whinnying maoe is harnessed to the car:
For thee the Afric juice

Deep dyae thy garments: me unswerving Doom
Has blaet with Grecian songs, tho' slight and few,
A rura! cot, and temper to assume
Scorn for the carping creW.
