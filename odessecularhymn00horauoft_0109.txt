BOOK THREE

111
On I ntegrity

HE righteous man of steadfast mind
From firrn raeolve is never thrust

By civil tumult rash and blind,
Nor tyrant’s frown, nor Auster's gust.

Rough lord of Hadria's restless swell,

Nor Jove's great hand whence lightning flies:

Undaunted such would stand tho' fell
With awful crash the very skies.

This virtue dowered with thronae divine
Pollux and roving Hercules

Mid whorn Augustus shall recline
ln roseate youth at nectared ease.

This, father Bacchus, brought reward
When harnaesed tigers safely sped
Thee skyward; so from death abhorred
With steeds of Mars Quirinus ssed,

When conclaved gods heard Juno speak
Right gladly: “llion, Ilion sank

ln ashes thro· a woman weak
And lecherous judge of princely ranl<;

'‘Was doomed by rne and Pallas chaste
With populace and fraudful chief,
What time Laomedon outfaced

The gods with guile beyond belief.

“The shamelaes guest no longer charms
His Spartan leman: Hector's spear

No more repels the Greeks in arms
Whom Priam's faithlaes people fear.
