THE ODES OF HORACE
When from the ethereal pole the ssame

2 Was filched‚ Decay and hosts of Fevers came

And brooded on earth's sickening face,
Till fateful Death his former laggard pace

Gave o'er‚ and strode with foot more sseet

Next Daedalus the empty air durst beat
With wings denied to man: the toil

Of Hercules gave Acheron the soil.

Before no task mankind will quan:

High heaven itself in folly we assail,
Nor will our sacrileges dire
Let Jove lay down the thunders of his ire.
