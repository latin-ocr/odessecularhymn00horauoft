THE ODES OF HORACE

XVI

To Grosphus

ΟΒ peace the sailor begs the gods on high,
Benighted on the broad Aegean wave,
When dark clouds hide the moon and from the sky
No stars shine forth to save;

For peace frenetic Thrace the battle sterns,
For peace the Mede his painted quiver bears,
But, Grosphus, neither purple, gold, nor gems
Can buy relies frorn cares.

Nor treasure nor the consul’s lictor band
Can frorn the mind hold wretched ills aloot‚
Nor banish griefs that ssit on every hand
About the fretted roof.

He lives on little happily who sees
The heirloorn salt-dish glisten at his board;
His gentle sleep thro' fear of theft ne’er flees‚
Nor thro' desire to hoard.

Since short our span why are rash aims inbred?
For climes ’neath other suns our course why shape?
What exile, frorn his native country ssed,
Can from himself escape?

Dull Care outstrips trooped horsemen ssying fast
And climbs the sides of galleys brazen—prowed.
More sseet than stags, more sseet than Eurus' blast

That drives the scudding cloud.

ln present joy the happy heart abidae,
Nor dreads the future2 with calm smile it still
Endures life’s bitter things. No good betidae
Without its chastening ill.
