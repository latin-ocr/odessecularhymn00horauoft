To Melpomene

UTLASTING bronze, a monument 1 rear
That o'er the regal pyramids towers sheer,

Which gnawing rains, nor blustering Aquilo,
Nor ceaselaes lapse of years. nor ages· flow

shall ’scape from Libitina, and my fame
Shall grow more bright 11110· aftertime's acclaim.

So long shall Aufidus· resounding 1111
And those patched lands where Daunus ruled hls hinds
Relate how l. enrolled mid greatest minds,

To Latin verse. Accept thy meed of praise
By merit woh, Melpomene. and now
with Delphlc laurel gladly wreathe my brow.
