THE ODES OF HORACE

IV

On W isdom

QUEEN Calliope, descend
From heaven, corne, play upon thy flute
Full strains or, if it please thee, blend
Thy trilling voice with Phoebus’ lute.

Listl hear ye her? or does it rove,
My idle fancy? Now meseerns

Ι hear and stroll thro' hallowed grove
Where zephyrs stray and pleasant streams.

Play-worn and sunl< in slumber sound,
On me a child, in Vultur’s waste

Beyond my nurse Apulia's bound,
The storied doves a covering placed

Of fresh green leaves: much marveled all
That hold high Acherontia’s nest.

The Bantine woodlands fair and tall,
And low Farentum's tillage blest,

That 1 from bears and deadly snakes
Slept safe, that, strewn with holy bay

And branches culled from myrtle brakes‚
Protected by the gods Ι lay.

Yours, dear Camenae, yours am l,
Tho' Sabine peaks exert their spell,

Tho’ pleased by Baiae’s liquid sky,
Praeneste cool, or Tibur’s dell.

Your founts' and dances’ friendly lure
Preserved me from the fatal tree‚
Philippi’s rout, and Palinure
That overlooks Sicilia's sea.
