To Xanthias

ΗΑΤ passion for thy handmaid sways thee now
Blush not, O Phocian Xanthias. Long ago
The thrall Briseis with her snowy brow
Made proud Achilles glow.

Giowed Telamonian Ajax, forced to crave
Tecmaesa's charms — the captive ruled her lordl —
Bumed, too, Atrides for a maiden slave,
ln triumph as he warred,

What time the thinned barbarian hosts were slain
By Phthia's victor chief, and Hector died,

· ⁷ Tin Pergama, now easier to gain,

Fen to the Greeks well tried.

Mayhap thine auburn Phyllis' sire designs
For thee, his son, both riches and renown:
Her race is doubtlaes royal and she pines
Because her home-gods frown.

Thy mistress springs from no plebeian breed:
Such stock would ne’er beget— make no demursl -—
Α maid so loyal and averse to greed;
No vulgar mother hers!

Her arms, her features, and her ankles trim,
1 praise them heartwhole; have no jealous fears
Of one whose hurrying life has brought to him
Fun tale of forty years.
