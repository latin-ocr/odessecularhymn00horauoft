14 THE ODES ΟΡ HORACE

vm
To Lydia

YD1A‚ tell me, 1 implore thee
By all gods', why wilt thou so young Sybaris unman?
Why, since low in love before thee,
Hates he sunny Field, tho· well inured to dust and tan?

Why no more with martIal bearing,

Mounted on his Gallie charger‚ rides he with his friends,
Rein and ganing bit not sparing?

Why in yenow Tiber swims no longer? For what ends

Shuns he now the oil as duly

As 'twere blood of vipers? Why no more does he appear—
Arms with contests glowing bluely —

Often victor with the discus, often with the spear?

Wherefore skulks he as, says story.

Skulked the son of sea-born Thetis ere Troy·s tearful doctu,
Lest his manly garb mid gory

Slaughter and mid Lycian squadrons speed him to his tomb?
