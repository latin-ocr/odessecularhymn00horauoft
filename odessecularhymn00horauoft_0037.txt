BOOK ONE 13

“Wherever Fortune, kinder than my father, bids us fare,
Ο comrades and allies, we now shall go:

Daepair not under Teucer’s guidance, under Teucer's care,
For Phoebus gives his promise there shall grow

“ln other lands a Salamis to bear the name anew.
Brave men, who oft with me have dated sustain

Severer ills than this, quaff wine and cease your toils to rue:
Tomorrow we resail the boundlaes main.''
