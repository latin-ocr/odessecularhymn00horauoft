THE ODES ΟΡ HORACE

“And valor, once rejected, cares

No more to dwell with coward scum.
lf does, released from tangled snares,
Will fight‚ to him may courage come

“Who to the faithless foeman lists:

Carthage again he rnay invade
Who felt the lash with corded wrists
And basely drooped, of death afraid.

“Scarce knowing how to save his life,

War he mistook for peace. O shamel
Shall mighty Carthage in this strife
Soar high o’er Latium’s ruined name?'’

As if all civil rights from him
Were rest, men said, his virtuous spouse
And babes he spurned, then, sternly grim,
Bent on the ground his manly brows

The wavering Fathers while he steeled
With counsel never elsewhere known.

Past friends whose tears their grief revealed
The glorious exile strode alone,

Tho' well he knew the torturing wrath
His foes would mete. He, calmly stern,

Brushed friends and kindred frorn his path
Who fain would stay his pledged return.

As if sorne client's tedious suit,

Just settled, left him free to fare
To green Venafrum, or recruit

His health in Greek Tarentum’s air.
