BOOK ONE 19

Down from the rocks the storm—tost water ssows,
The clouds disperse, and whist is every breeze.
While, such Their will, the thraetening waves repose

Upon the untroubled seas.

Shall Romulus or Numa's peaceful time,
Of mortal subjects, first command my broeth?
Shall Tarquin's glorious fasces ask my rime,
Or Cato's noble death?

Fain in emblazoning verse would l make known
Fabricius, Regulus. the Scauri's fame,
And Paulus, he whose high-souled conduct shone
When Carthage overcame.

Stern poverty, a small ancestral field,

f And humble cottage hardened to the shocks

of war Camillus, yea, and Curius steeled,
Stanch with his shaggy locks.

Marcellus' glory, tree-like, thro' the years
Grows imperceptibly; mid all shinae bright
The star of Julius. as the moon appoers
Mid loeser lires of night. ’

Guardian and Sire to whom mankind must bow,
O Saturn's son, the Daetiniae decree
Great Caesar to thy care: supreme reign thou
With Caesar next to thee.

Whether 'gainst Medes that menace Rome he pour
His armies till the foe for mercy sue,
whether the Seres of the Eastern shore
And lndians he subdue,

Thy regent. he shall justly rule the world:
Thine ’tis to shake high heaven with ponderous car,
Thine to blast guilty grovae with lightnings hurled
ln anger from afar.
