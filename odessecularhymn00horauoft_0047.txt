BOOK ONE 23

“Whom, as the hart, his pasturage forsaking,
Fleae when a wolf within the glade has stem,
Thou, coward-like, shalt flee, all breathless, quaking—
Boasts to thy love unkept.

“Achilles’ wrathful fleet may stay disaster
A space from Phrygia's dames and llion's domes:
Few winters yet and Danaan firae shall master
The Pergamean homes.'’
