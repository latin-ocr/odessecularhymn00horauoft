To my Companions

O fight with tankards wrought for glee

Is Thracian coarseness; be raetrained
Brute mirth, laet blushing Bacchus see
His ritae by bloody brawls profaned.

'Ibe Median dir-k with lamps and wIne
ls dissonantly out of place:

On cushioned elbows, friends. recline,
And banish riot low and base.

Shall 1 with you Falernian drain
γ ln heady drafts? Then let us know,
Megylla’s brother, art thou slain?

whose dart drove home the happy blow?

What. silent? speak; 1 drink not else.
whatever mistraes ruloe thy heart,
No vulgar fure thy bosom melts;
Some gentle love inflicts the smart.

Whate'er thy lot, come, name the girl
ln trusty aers. —Alas, for shame!
what. trapped in that Charybdis' swirl‚

Youth, worthy of a better flame?

What wizard with Thaesalian drench,

That witch‚ what god can blast her charms?
Thee scarcely Pegasus could wrench

From this three-formed Chimera’s harms.
