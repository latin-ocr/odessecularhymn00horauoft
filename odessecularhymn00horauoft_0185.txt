THE SECULAR HYMN 161

Now ancient Reverence comes and Honor true.
with Peace and virtue lately held in scorn.
And Faithfulnaes: see. blithesome plenty. too,
Comes with her brimming horn.

Phoebus the seer, who bears upon his back
His fulgent bow, beloved by Muses nine.
Who frees the body’s aching limbs from rack

By healing art divine:

If altars on the Palatine engage
His sanction high, Rome's weal and Latium’s power

May he prolong until another age
And ever better hour.

May huntress Dian, too, who often fares
On Aventine and Algidus, stin bend
To Quindecemvirs’ vows. and to youths' prayers
With partial ear attend.

That Jove accedes and all his synod train,
Sure hope is mine as homeward l retire,
Much pleased with Phoebus’ and Diana’s strain
Sung by my well-drilled choir.
