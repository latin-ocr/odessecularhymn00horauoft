The Praises of Latona and her Children

E tender virgins, sing Diana chaste,
Ye boys, sing Cynthius with his unshorn hair,
And dark Latona, highly graced
In mighty Jove's most loving care.

Extoi her, maids, who loves the grovoe that loom,
The brooks that purl, where Algidus stands chiii,
Where Erymanthian forests gioom,
And Cragus lifts its greener hili.

Ye males, laud Tempe with an equal lay,
γ And Deios, as Apollo's birthplace known,
And shoulder‚ decked with quiver gay
And lute his brother used to own.

He tearful war, he plague and famine gaunt
Shall drive from Caesar and the Commonweal,
The Britons and the Medes to haunt,
Moved by your suppliant appeal.
