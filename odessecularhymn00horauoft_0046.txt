22 THE ODES OF HORACE

The Prophz of Nereus

HEN the false swain was bearing o'er the ocean
His hostaes Helen in the ldean fleet,
An hateful calm lulled rapid winds from rnotion
That Nereus might repeat

His dreadful prophecies. “With luckless omen
Thou lead'st her home. Mark serried Greece elatel
See thy wrecked nuptials when the leaguing foemen
Rend Priam's ancient state!

“Alasl what sweating steedsl what warriors’ clangor!
What balefires threat the Dardan race from farl
Lol Pallas takes her aegis and her anger,
Her helmet and her car.

¹⁴ 'Twere vain, tho' brave while Venus* help is present,
To comb thy curls and wake the unwarlike shell
With madrigals that women find so pleasant:
’Twere vain in bower to dwell

“And hide from heavy spears, light Cnossian lances,
Swift-footed Ajax, and war’s clamor wild.
Thy guilty locks —alas, the day advancesl —
Shall soon be dust-defiled.

“See Laertiades, who hates thy nation,
And Pylian Nestor see: to urge thy ssight
Bold Salaminian Teucer takes his station,
And Sthenelus, skilled in sight,

“Adept at need with car and coursers‚ hurries:
Thou shalt know Menon: greater than his sire,
Cruel Tydides, searching for thee, scurries
With battle lust on fire,
