104 THE ODES OF HORACE

xlv

The Return of Augustus

COMMONS, just as Hercules of yore,
Tho· death should be the price, sought crowns of bay,
So conquering Caesar from the Spanish shore
Comes horne again to-day.

Since thou to righteous heaven hast proffered thanks‚
Corne forth, O matron, faithful to thy spouse,
Our famous leader's sister, too. and ranks
Of dames whose suppliant brows

Are circleted in gratitude to learn
Of sons' and daughters‘ safety. l beseech
Ye, youths and maidens yet unwed‚ to spurn
All unpropitious speech.

This truly festal day shall banish all
My somber cares: while Caesar's mandates bend
The empire, 1 shall sear nor civil brawl
Nor death by violent end.

Haste, boy. both balms and wreaths this day demands.
Wine, too, whose date harks back to Marsian strife,
1f aught, perchance‚ escaped when ‘roving bands
Of Spartacus were rife.

Then bid clear-voiced Neaera haste to tie
ln comely knot her wealth of chestnut hair,
But if her porter churl thy knock deny,
Begone, nor tarry there.

Α whitening head subdues the soul that long
lnclined to spleen and quarrels’ headstrong grip:
My fiery youth would not have brooked such wrong

ln Plancus' consulship.
