32 THE ODES OF HORACE

xxiv
To V irgil

HY feel ashamed because of boundless sorrow
For loss of one so dear? Melpomene,
Blest by the Sire with song and lute, 1 borrow
A mournful strain from thee.

Quintilius raets in everlasting siumber!
Can Modesty and Truth unfettered, then,
And stainIess Honor, Justice‘ sister, number
His peer on earth again?

He died and many worthy men lament him:
Than thou, O Virgn, none laments him more.
Ah, vain the thought that Heaven, who merely lent him,
Quintilius will restore!

Tho' sweeter tones thy lyre give forth, when stricken‚
Than Thracian Orpheus: listening forests knew,
Fresh life the hollow shade will never quicken
Mid the dim spectra! crew

Once Mercury extends, to prayers unheedful,
His awesome rod and all return denies.
Hard this: but in endurance of the needful

Our surest comfort lies.
