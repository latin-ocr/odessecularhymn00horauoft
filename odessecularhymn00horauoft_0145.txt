BOOK THREE 121

Lately on weaving coronals intent,
Vowed to the Nymphs, she roamed the flowery leas;
At glimmering night her troubled gaze was bent
On naught but stars and seas.

But when at last on mighty Crete she stept,
The hundred-citied‚ “Sire, Ο filial fame
Now gone! O sense of duty, too,” she wept,

“Quite lost thro' frenzy's flamel

“Whence, whither carne l? Maiden fault like this
Daeerves more deaths than one. Am Ι awake,
Weeping my sin, or, free from aught amiss,
Doffi some false phantom make

“A mock of me and bring thro’ ivory port
Α guileful dream? Across long waves that lower,

Α Say, was it baet to go, the billows' sport,

Or pluck the new-blown ssower?

“Were this vile bull delivered to my hate,
How would l hack him with the griding steel,
And lop the horns from off that brute, so late
The object of my zeall

“Shameless l left my father's hearth-fire glow,
Shamelaes my debt to Orcus still l waive;
Ο if some god but hear me, let me go,
Naked, where lions ravel

“Ere from my dainty form my bloom has ssed,
And comely cheeks are marred by foul decay,
While still alluring, let the tigers shred
My body for their prey.

“l seem to hear my absent sire's command,
‘Ah, base Europa, compass now thy death;
This ash invites and— luckily at hand -
Thy zone will check thy breath.
