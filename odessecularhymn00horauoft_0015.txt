PREFACE

N working over this translation of the Odes of Horace

l have been increasingly impressed by the conviction that
any version of the poet, in order to convey, even in a
shadowy manner. the general effect of the original, must
maintain in its verse-structure an approximate equivalence
to the Latin. Each translated ode must conform in general
appearance, division into strophae, and length and number
of verses to its prototype, and each instance of any given
Horatian meter must invariably be rendered into its English
analogue as selected by the translator. Types of odae
should be rigidly adhered to, and the fact that Horace uses
a given measure to sing such varying themae as the dutiae
of patriotism and the lure of wine, the companionship of
friends and the praises of the gods, should excuse no devia·
tion from the principle. Then, too, some degree of the
compactness of thought and brevity of expression that
characterize the original must be attempted —some of
Horace's own terseness must be brought into play if he is
at all adequately to be reproduced. That l should employ
rime is inevitable, for it has been well said that while one
or two rare souls during the course of a generation may write
readable blank verse, most men, if they hope to be endured‚
must raeort to the aid of rime. lt will thus be seen that 1
have striven to follow, though necessarily at a distance, the
rules laid down by John Conington, a man whose aptitude
for Horatian translation fell but little short of genius, and
of whom it may truthfully be said,

Nec viget quicquam simile aut secundum.

Most of the meters l have used have been much em·
