PREFACE xiii

have been cast into stanzas like those used in the Sapphlc
odes, save that the first and third verses have been given
feminine endings. The measure adopted in translating the
Sapphics was probably best fitted for the Third Asclepiads,
but 1 found a shorter verse unworkable for the Sapphic
poenis: so, therefore, in englishing the Asclepiads l have
added an extra syllable to two verses for purposae of differ-
entiation.

The seven Fourth Asclepiads (odes written in the measure
of i, 5) have been arranged in iambic stanzas consisting of
two pentameters followed by two tetrameters, disposing the
rimes alternately.

The three First Asclepiads (odes like i, 1) have been put
into rimed heroic couplets, the three Fifth Asclepiads (odes
written in the measure of i, 11) have been cast into con-
secutively riming iambic heptameters, and the two Alcmanic
Odes (i, 7 and i, 28) have been englished into iambic stan-
zas made up of two heptameter and two pentameter verses,
alternately disposed and alternately riming.

Most of the odes. then, as was but natural, employ
iambic measures‚ but in a few instancae l have made use
of other forms. The two spring-songs (i, 4 and iv. 7)
seemed from their very content to call for the lightneae of
treatment that anapaets alone can impart and the Ode to
a Miser (ii. 18), with the few solemn chords suggaetive of
Longfellow's “Psalm of Life‚'' appeared ready to fall natu-
rally into trochees. ln allotting trochees to the Ode to
Lydia (i, 8) and dactyls to the Neobule Ode (iii, 12) perhaps
l have been led quite as much through a desire for variety
as through any feeling of individual fitness.

ln making this translation, 1 have availed myself of the
comment of a number of the best-known editors and 1 have

⁷ not hesitated freely to use wealth drawn from the great

storae collected by many generations of Horatian scholars.

There is, however, one matter that l wish to mention
with a note of extenuation. Since this version has rfflched
what is practically its present form 1 have carefully ex·
amined the works of a half dozen of the most celebrated
metrical translators‚ and l find that not infrequently 1 have
