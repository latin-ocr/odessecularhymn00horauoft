d THE ODES OF HORACE

X

To Mercury

ERCURY, Atlas' grandchild suave of tongue,
Whose forewit could primeva! men reclaim
From savagery by speech, by graces wrung
From gymnasts’ wrestling game:

Herald of mighty Jove and his compeers,
Thee. father of the curving lyre, 1 hymn,
Clever to hide thy thefts, with pranksome leers,
Whenever comes the whim.

Thee. yet a boy, while chiding for the sleight
By which his lifted beeves he needs must rue,
Apollo laughed at in his own despite—
His quiver pilfered‚ tool

So, led by thee, and 'neath a ransom bowed‚
Priam his stealthy steps from llion bent‚
And passed Thessaliam fires, the Atridae prend,
And every hostile tent.

Thy duty 'tis with pious souls to ply
To blissful seats and guide with golden wand
Light phantom, thou of whom both gods on high
And gods below are fond.
