To the Ship in which V irgil Embarked

Ο may the cyprian queen of might,
So Helen's brethren, stars of lucid light,
And, too, the father of the galae—
Au save lapyx pent within their pales—

Guide thee, Ο ship‚ who owest me
Virgss, to thee intrusted; hear my plea
And safely to the Attic shore

Consign the idol of my bosom’s core.

With triple bronze and rugged oak
’ His brfflst was fortified, who dared provoke
Wild ocean with the first frail bark,-
Nor fwed mad Africus with Boreas dark

At strife‚ nor tristful Hyades,
Nor Notus raging o'er the darkling seas,
The mightiest lord of Hadria·s tide,
whether he bid it roughen or subside.

what form of death could chin his blood
Who viewed the wanowing monsters of the stood,

Who kennech· dry-eyed‚ thsssse'ssking deep, ⁷
And (hated cliffsl) the Acroceraunian steep?

ln vain has God so wisely planned
By ocean’s waste to sever land from land,

lf. manger this, men yet wil! brave‚
ln ships profane, the Inviolable wave.

Rashly doeirous all to win,

The human race ramps thro· forbidden sin:
Rashly Iapetus· bold son

By guilty craft heaven's fure for mor-tals won.
