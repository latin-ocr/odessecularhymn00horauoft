BOOK Two 67

The marveling shades in silence hear

Rapt strains from both, but more they yearn.
With shoulder prest and listening ear,

Of wars and banished chiefs to learn.

What wonder! Cerberus, crouching there,
Droops his dun ears, by warbling blest

Subdued, and in the Furiesâ€™ hair
The writhing snakes are lulled to rest.

Prometheus, yffi, and Pelops' sire

List the sweet sound till anguish sinks,
Nor doae Orion care to tire

The lion and the wary lynx.
