And chase to Dis itself each guilty deed.
Most foul! (what crime more impious could they brave?)

Most fouH who dared to bid their bridegrooms bleed
Beneath the ruthlaes glaive.

One only, of the nuptia! torch's ssame
Deserving. brooked her perjured father's tage,
And, glorious1y false, her honored name
Survivae to every age.

“Arise,” she whispered to her husband young,
“Arise, lest thou in endless slumber dwess,
Sent from a source unfeared; death lurks among
My sire and sisters fell,

“Who seize and rend. like lionosses fierce.
Each one her steer. alas! More kind than they,
1 will not mew thee close nor yet transpierce
An unsuspecting prey.

“Me let my father load with cruel chains
Because my hapless spouse 1 chose to spate,
Me in his navy to Numidia's plains
Far distant let him bear.

“l-laste, whither feet and winds may take thee, haste
γ 1η happy hour, while Venus and night’s gioom
Lend aid. and be my mournful story traced
By thee upon my tomb.''
