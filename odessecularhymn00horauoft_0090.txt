THE ODES OF HORACE

xm
To a Fallen Tree

N luckless day he set thee out,
Whoe'er he was, Ο tree, and reared
With impious hand, to towns about
Α shame to be in future feared.

That man, 1 think, by strangling sped
His father, and his hearth would stain
With midnight blood of guest abed:
All evil deeds, each Colchian bane,

Wherever known, were known to him
Who planted thee, disastrous bole,

Thee, in my croft, with toppling limb
To threat thy blameless master’s poll.

What fate to ssee from hour to hour
We know not: Punic seamen mark
The Bosporus where tempests lower, ,

But heed no other perils dark.

We dread the Mede that fights and ssies,
The Mede fears chains and Latian oak;
Yet death in unexpected guise
Has harried and will harry folk.

How nearly ’twas my lot to know
Swart Proserpine's domain in hell,

J udge Aeacus, blest seats below,
With Sappho keening o'er her shell

For loveless Lesbian girls, and thee
Whose golden quill woke louder lays,
Alcaeus, of the grievous sea,
Most grievous exile, grievous fraysl
