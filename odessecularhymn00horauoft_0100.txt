THE ODES OF HORACE

ΧΙΧ

Α Dithyramb

ACCHUS mid crags remote 1 found,
Whose hymns — give credence, future years! —
He taught to listening Nymphs around
While goat-hooved Fauns pricked up their ears.

Evoel new fears my bosom tear:

My pulses, filled with Bacchus, quake:
Evoel O spare rne, Liber, spare;

No more thy potent thyrsus shake.

Sing we the Thyiads, tireless still,

Rich brooks of milk that thread the leas‚
The founts of wine, the honeyed rill

That oozes frorn the hollow trees:

Sing, too, thy consort's blissful state
And starry crown, the wrack abhorred
Of Pentheus' palace, and the fate
Of mad Lycurgus, Thracia's lord.

Thou swervest streams, thou ocean wide,
Thou, flushed with wine, in lonely spots
Bistonian Maenads' hair hast tied
With vipers wreathed in harmless knots.

By thee, when impious Giant throng
Thy father’s lofty kingdom scaled,
Was Rhoetus backward dashed along,
By lion's claws and fangs assailed.

Best known in dance and quip and game,
Tho' thought unequal to the might

Of battle, still thou wert the same,
Whether mid scenes of peace or fight.
