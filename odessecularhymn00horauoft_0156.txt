132 THE ODES OF HORACE

There twice each day shall youths combine
With tender maids to laud thy power divine.

While their white feet shall lightly bound
In Salian mode and triply beat the ground.

Me woman charms not, no, nor lad,

Nor idle dream of mutual hearts made glad,
Nor jar that bodes the deep carouse,

Nor wreath of opening buds to bind my brows.

But why, ah, Ligurinus, why

Flows now and then the teardrop from mine eye?
Why halt the accents on my tongue,

Once free but now to awkwaâ€˜rd silence stung?

In airy visions of the night

1 clasp thee now, now traci< thee in thy ssight
Across the Campus Martius: tui-f,

Now, cruel that thou arti thro' boiling suff.
