THE ODES OF HORACE

xii
In Praise os Augustus

ΗΑΤ man, what hero, on thy vocal lute
Or shrilling bibe, Ο Clio, wilt thou praise?
What god? Whose name shall sportive echo bruit
Amid the wooded ways

That skirt umbrageous Helicon, or where
Soars Pindus' peak or Haemus’ frigid erest,
Whence groves were urged confusedly to fare
At tuneful Orpheus' hest,

Who, tutored by his mother, learned to stay
The streams' swift currents and the breezes strong,
And, conquering by his strings' melodious sway‚
Drew listening oaks along?

Who but the Parent first demands my sti-ain,
Who governs gods above and men below,
Who rules the skies, the earth, and heaving main,
As seasons ebb and ssow?

Naught greater than himself from him has birth,
Nor like him, nor that holds a second place;
Yet dignitiae possessing neighbor worth
The brows of Pallas grace,

Dauntless in battle: nor may 1 withhold
From Liber praise, nor, virgin, thee, whose craft
Slays savage beasts, nor thee, Ο Phoebus, bold
With thine unerring shaft.

Alcides, next, and Leda's twins 'tis mine
To sing; this teins the steed, that featly spars:
But when on seamen thro’ the vapors shine
Their lambent-twinkling stars,
