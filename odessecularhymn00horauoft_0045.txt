To the Ship os State

SHlP, new waves upon the open main
Again will sweep thee! Whither drivest thou?
The harbor stoutly strive to gain:
Thy bulwarks, see! are naked now

Of oars, swift Africus thy mast has sprung,
Thy rigging hangs in shreds, thy yard-arms creak‚

Thy hun, the imperious seas among,

To bide the stress is all too weak:

Thine every sail is rent, no gods are thine
To can upon when storms are ill withstood.

Th0' builded wess of Pontic pine—

The daughter of a noble wood ——

’Πιε magic of thy name and race to court
Were vain, for cautious sailors never dare
To trust their gaudy sterns: the sport
Of winds laet thou wouidst be, beware!

Th0u art my fond desire, my foremost pride,
Th0' once distrust usurped the place of thoee.
Forbear to navigate the tide
That laves the gleaming Cyclades.
