BOOK ONE

XXXVI 11

To my Cupbearer

HIS Persian luxury, my boy, l hate,
Nor care for chaplets bound with linden bast:
lnquire not in what covent, blooming late,
The rosae linger last.

To beautify plain myrtle never think,
1 pray thee: meet are myrtlae that we twine
For thee who servaet and for me who drink
Beneath my close-pleached vine.
