BOOK FOUR 139

V

To Augustus

ORN frorn kind gods, too long art thou delaying;
For thee, Rome’s guardian baet. her children yearm
Haste, see augustly conclaved Fathers praying
For thy pledged quick return!

Again‚ good chief, light to thy country render:
When on the people beams thy gracious gaze
Like springtide's warmth, suns glow with greater splendor
And blithelier pass the days.

As for her son, whom Notus· gusty rancor
Beyond Carpathian ocean's level brine

, For longer than a year has held at anchor‚

Doomed for sweet horne to pine.

A mother calls with omen, prayer, oblation‚
And ceases not to scan the winding shores,
So, smitten with a longing love, our nation
Thine absence still deplores.

Thro’ meadows safely roams the ox, our tillage
Ceres and bland Fecundity have blest,
The sailors skim o’er seas now freed from pillage,
Leal Honor meets each test,

The virtuous home is ne’er by lust defrauded,
Custom and law have stamped out taint and stain,
For children like her spouse the wife is lauded,
Vengeance dogs guilt amain.

Who fears the Medes‚ who Scyths from icy regionss
Or who the swarrns that rough Germania breeds,
While Caaear prospers? Who the warrior legions
of fierce lberia heeds?
