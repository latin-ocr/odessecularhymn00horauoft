The Secular Hymn

HOEBUS and chaste Diana, foraetnueen.
Heaven's lucent orbs, always adored and aye
To be revered. look down with gracious mien
Upon this sacred day,

On which the Siby1·s versiclae have willed
That, by pure youths and virgins nobly sprung,
To those high gods that love our town seven-hilled
A lofty hymn be sung.

O fostering sun. thro' whom, in car of gold,
Days come and go, another yet the same
At every dawning, naught mayst thou behold

Greater than Rome’s proud name.

Ο llythia, laboring mothers spare;
without a throe let ripened births appear:
Lucina, Genitalis, howsoe'er
Thou wouldst be known. be nfflr.

Goddaes, train up our children, so shalt thou

Prosper the Fathers' laws, by whose behaet

The wedded wife shall see her marriage vow
With numerous offspring blaet,

That‚ rolling on thro' years eleven times ten,
The cycle may with songs and garn& delight
The crowds thrice thro’ the cloudlaes day, and then
As oft at pleasant night.
