XlV PREFACE

used rimes that are not new, and in at least three cases 1
have used lines that are precise duplicates of those of prede-
cessors. These last 1 have allowed to stand unchanged, for
they are, in each instance, literal renderings of the Latin,
and similar modes of expression naturally suggest them-
selves occasionally to different workers in the same field.
ln the matter of identity of rime now and then, l can only
say that Horace has been translated into English a great
many times, and, as a given thought or strophe can be ex·
pressed in but a limited number of ways, it follows that the
supply of original rimes must ultimately give out and that
each new translator must find himself in increasingly dif-
ficult straits to avoid the phraseology of his predecessor-5.
lf, as a whole, my work shows originality‚ 1 shall hope to
be acquitted of the charge of indolently and unfairly profit·-
ing by the labors of others.

For this addition to the many attempts “to translate the
untranslatable'' l shall find, perhaps, in the minds of many,
but scant excuse, yet it has been with me a labor of love,
and l have been supported by the hope that it may bring
some knowledge of the poet to a few who before were un-
acquainted with him and that it may be not without inter·
est to some who are familiar with the original. Perhaps the
following sentence may prove my baet justification: “No
words can express the impossibility of any adequate trans-
lation of the poet, yet the lure will always prove irresistible.” ¹

The text followed is, with but two exceptions, that of
Professor Charles E. Bennett of Cornell University,¹ and 1
am indebted to his notes for useful hints regarding the
interpretation of certain moot points.

ln closing‚ 1 wish thankfully to express my hearty ac-
knowledgments to Professor Bennett for the kindliness that
prompted him to examine my work and for the shrewd
scholarship that furnished many helpful criticisms.
