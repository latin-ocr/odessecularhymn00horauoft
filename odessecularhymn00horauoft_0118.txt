THE ODES OF HORACE

Before her conscious husband's εγω
She rises if a peddler come,

Or Spanish skipper, one who buys
Her favors for a good round sum.

No sons of parents such as these
Dire Hannibal and Pyrrhus foiled‚

Distained with Punic gore the seas.
And great Antiochus despoiled.

Of hardy stock were those who fought.
Yeomen who with Sabellian spade

Turned up the stubborn clod, then brought
Trimmed fagots home, and thus obeyed

Stern mothers‚ when from distant rocks
The sinking sun threw shadows wide,

Removed the yoke from wearied ox,
And ushered in calm eventide.

What age but brings a weightier ill?
Our fathers, than our grandsires worse,
Begat us, offspring baser still,
Whose sons shall prove a viler curse.
