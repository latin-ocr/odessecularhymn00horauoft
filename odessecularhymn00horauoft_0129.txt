BOOK THREE

XV

To Chloris

IFE of poor Ibycus. ’tis time
To fix a limit to thy course of crime,
Thine infamy. and wantonness.
Since thou art ripe for death, amid the press

Of graceful virgins* cease to play

And cloud the starry luster of their day.
What Pholoe may fitly dare,

Chloris, becomae thee not: thy daughter fair

Rapping gallants' closed doors may come,
Like Thyiad crazed when rolls the kettledrum,
For Nothus' love has made her dote

And caper madly as a wanton goat,

Wool shorn near famed Luceria's seat

Baeeems thee now, not citterns' erooning sweet‚

Nor scarlet rosae' bloom, nor kegs,
Thou wizened beldam, emptied to the dregs.
