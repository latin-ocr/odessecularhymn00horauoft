46 THE ODES OF HORACE

xxxv¹
The Return of Numida

HILE votive bullocks bleed 'tis ours

To appease with spice and lutes the guardian powers
Of Numida, who, now at hand

In safety from Hesperia’s distant strand,

Brings store of kisses to his host

Of cherished friends but gives loved Lamia most,
Because with him in schoolboy days

He worked beneath the selfsame master-'s gaze,

And with him donned the manly gown.
With Cretan mark the festa! day jot down,
Let generous pitchers freely ssow,
No rest the foot from Salian dances know,

In Thracian bout with frequent draft
By Darnalis be Battus not outquaft,

And on the board, by roses graced.
Be parsley green and short-lived 1111ae placed.

The swimming eyes of all will turn
To Damalis, but Damalis will yearn

For her new love, and to him cling
Closelier than wanton {vies oaks enring.
