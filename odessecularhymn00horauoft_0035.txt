To Agrippa

ET Varius, songster of Maeonian feather,
Proclaim thy prowess and the foae’ eclipse
Achieved by warriors 'neath thy guidance, whether
With cavalry or ships.

1 cannot sing, Agrippa, of thy daring,
of pitilaes Pelidae’ quenchlaes wrath‚
Pelops' grim house, or shrewd Ulyaeoe faring
O'er ocean's devious path.

Τοο slight for massive thernae, my modest phrases
ff And Muse that thriils the peaceful lyre decree
That my dull wit dim not the lofty praisae

Of Caaear and of thee.

For who of Mars in adamant hauberk striding,
Or Merion grimed with dust of Trojan plain,
Or Diomed‚ match for gods thro* Panas’ guiding,

Can sing in worthy strain?

1. whether fancy-free or passion-ladem
ln lightsome mood, as is my wont. must sing
The harmies quarrel of the youth and maiden.
’Πιε banquet's mirthful ring.
