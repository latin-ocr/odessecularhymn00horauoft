To Chloe

HOU shun’st me, Chloe, like a tendet fawn
That seeks o'er pathloes hills the timid doe,
To visionary terrors drawn
lf thickets gloom or zephyrs blow.

Whether the advent of the spring awake
The leavoe' susurrus, or green lizards start
A mstling in the brambly brake,
She tremblae in her kneffi and heart.

Yet am 1 no Gaetulian lion wild,

ἶ No tiger fierce that seeks to crush thy charms:

Thy mother leave, no more a child,
And blas a husband’s longing arms.
