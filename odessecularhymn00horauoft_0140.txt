THE ODES OF HORACE

Restrained our license loose and slack. a
So men unborn shall hail him, for, alackl
Live virtues meet our envious hate:
Borne from our gaze, we seek thern when too late.

Of what avail is sad complaint

lf punishment prune not our vicious talnt?
Of what avail is futile law

1f morals ssee? if love of lucre draw 1

Our merchants to the stissing clime
That girds one part of earth, or where the rime
Congeals the ground, the world's far verge
Where Boreas reigns? if daring sailors urge

Their vessels o'er the gulfy deep?
Lo, straitened means, a great reproach, will keep “
Men nerved to do and suffer all,
While arduous virtue’s pathways vainly call.

Now in the Capitol best0w‚

While clamorous crowds applaud us as we go. “’
Now in the nearest ocean toss

Our jewels, gems, and gold, all baneful dross,

1f conscience truly be not numb.

For from this source our chiefest evils come.
The roots of our insatiate greed

Must be plucked up, our aim must be to breed

ln weakling hearts desire for worth

By means of rougher schooling. Lads of birth
Cannot on horseback keep their seat

And dare not hunt: at naught will they compete

But trundling Grecian hoops along

And throwing dice, which statute rulae as wrong.
Meantirne their cheating fathers steal

Alike from trusting friends and partners leal,
