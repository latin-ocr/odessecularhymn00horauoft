BOOK THREE

“Troy, born to ἰΙΙ if brought to life,

Would see dire wrack renew its course,
For 1 myself, Jove's sister-wife,

Would marshal on the conquering force.

'‘Tho' thrice should rise a wall of brass
By Phoebus built. it thrice would fail
Before my Argivae; thrice‚ alas!

Thralled wivae would matae and babae bewail.”

Such songs fut not my playful lute.
Bold Muse, where wilt thou? Cease to prate

The speech of gods, nor strive to bruit
From strings so slight a theme so great.
