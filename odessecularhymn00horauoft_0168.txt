THE ODES OF HORACE

VIII

To Censorinus

FAIN would give rare plate and bronzes‘ bright,

Ο Censorinus, for my friends' delight,
Yes‚ l would give fair tripods, meeds that fall
To striving Greeks, nor should thy gift be small
If I were rich, that is, in works of art
Where Scopas or Parrhasius could impart.
ln marble that and this in colors gay,
A form to man or god in skillful way.
Such wealth l have not, and thy fortune sees
Thy taste ne’er want for baubles such as these.
Thou lovest songs, and songs l can bestow,
Α gift whose priceless value well l know.
Not eulogies by State on marbles traced,
Whence, after death, the breath of life is placed
In valiant chiefs; not threats recoiling dread
On Hannibal, when hastily he ssed:
Not impious Carthage, wrapt in sheets of name,
More clearly tells his praise, who took his name
And won renown from Afri-ca subdued‚
Than do the Muses of Calabria's brood.
lf poet's scroll were hushed‚ then high emprise
Would know no guerdon. What of fame would rlse
To Romulus, of Mars and Ilia born,
If envious silence held his worth in scorn?
The gifted bard’s voice, grace, and merit save
Good ‘Aeacus from oozy Stygian wave
And shrine hirn mid the lslands of the Blest.
The Muse from death the worthy man will wrest:
She grants him heaven. So Hercules untired
Partakes the feast of Jove, so long desired;
E'en so those stars, the bright Tyndaridae,
Snatch battered vessels from the unplumbed sea:
So Liber, with green vine-shoots round his brow‚
To happy issue guides the suppliant's vow.
