100 THE ODES OF HORACE

xl
To Mercury and the Lute

ERCURY —⁸for by thine instruction taught'
Amphion moved thro’ song huge blocks of stone—
And thou, O shell, to whom the seven strings brought
Sweet strains till then unknown;

Not loquent once nor pleasing, now a source
Of joy at wealthy banquet or in fane,
Breathe music forth for Lyde that perforce
Her stubborn ear may gain.

Wide o'er the field, like filly three years old,
She skips and bounds, unwilling to be curbed,
Too young to wed and by no longings bold
For ardent mate disturbed.

The tigers and their native sylvan lairs
Thou leadest, rushing streams by thee are stayed,
Sometimes thy blandishment the gateman snares
ln Pluto's halls of shade,

Huge Cerberus, altho’ a hundred snakes
Protect the Fury-likeness of his head,
While from his three-tongued mouth black venom breaks
And noisome fumes dispread.

lxion, too, and Tityos despite
Their anguish smiled; each empty ewer stood still
A space, while to the Danaids carne delight,
Lulled by thy welcome thrill.

Let Lyde know the crime, the well-known woes
Those virgins feel; how from each leaking urn
The stream of water thro' the bottom ssows;
How Fate, tho' slow, will turn
