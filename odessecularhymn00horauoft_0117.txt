On Home Purity

N thee will τῶι thy fathers’ stain
Tho' guiltlaes, Roman, till thou put

And statue grimed with dingy soot.

Launch ventures, and decree succaes:

When scorned‚ they rigorously school
Hesperias land with sore distress.

Twice Pacorus and Monaeses checked

The unhallowed onslaughts of our powers,

And, facoe all aglow, have decked
Their tawdry torques with spoil of ours.

Dacian and Aethiop nearly razed
Our town by faction torn apart:
This for his dreaded sseet is praised,

That better shoots the flying dart.

These iron tirnes have tainted first

Our children, homes, and nuptial band,
ΤίΙΙ ruin every bound has burst

And deluged folk and fatherland.

Precociously the maiden trips

Ionian measures and, tho’ young,
Thrills to her very finger tips,

By wanton arts and fancies stung:

Anon she seeks for youthful rakae,
The while her spouse is swilling wine.
Nor cares which blade his pleasure takes
The first, when candles cease to shine;
