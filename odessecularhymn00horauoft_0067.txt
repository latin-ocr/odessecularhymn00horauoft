My Renunciation of False Philosophy

CANT homage to the gods 1 gave
While senselaes sapience was my creed:
Now back 1 sai! across the wave
And of my former course take heed.

For tho· full often Father Jove

Rivae clouds with nashing bolts from far,
Just now athwart the blue he drove

His thundering steeds and rapid car.

The stable land, the gliding streams,
Styx, Atlas, earth's extremaet bound,

And hated Taenarus· grisly seams,
Stin shudder at the fearsome sound.

God lifts the low, casts down the high,
Abasae pride. makae rich the poor:

Oft Fate on whirring vans will ssy.
Depose the king, and crown the boor.
