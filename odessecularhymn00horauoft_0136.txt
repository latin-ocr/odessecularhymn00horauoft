ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE

XXI

In Praise of Wine

BORN with me in Manlius' day,
whether, good jar, for us thou keep

Love plaints, or jests, or drunken fray,

Or madding loves, or easeful sleep—

Whiche'er of these, with sovereign power,
Thy genereus Massic conjure up,

Come down, be broached in happy hour,
Corvinus asks a mellower cup.

From thee none sourly stands aloof,
Tho· saturate with Socratic lore,
Nor was old Cato's virtue proof
'Gainst heartening wine, they say. of yore.

Where'er thy gentle spur is brought.

E’en dullard brains some wit must yie1d;
The sage's cares and secret thought

To arch Lyaeus stand revealed.

Thou placest hope in minds distraet,

Thy power and horns become the churl's‚
Who then at monarchs' ireful erest

And soldiers' mai! defiance hurls.

Thee Venus, if she join our throng,
Liber, the Graces bonded tight‚
And wakeful tapers shall prolong
Tin Phoebus put the stars to ssight.
