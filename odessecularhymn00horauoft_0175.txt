To Lyce

HE gods have hearkened‚ Lyce, to my prayer,
The gods have haerkened‚ Lyce: tho' a crone
And sot, thou still wouldst pass for fair.
And shamelaes wilcis are all thine own,

When, in thy cups, thy maudlin song baepeaks
Ungracious Cupid's favor. Guard he stands
ln loveiy Chia's pretty cheeiss
And hears the lute obey her hands.

Past knarry oaks he ssits with scornful pace >
And, startled at thy foulnaes he has ssed
The wrinkles grooved upon thy face,
Thy blackened teeth, and snowy head.

Nor precious stones nor Coan purple's weft
Will e'er to thee those happier hours recall
Which sseeting time from thee has reft
And iocked in archivae scanned by all.

Where ssed thy iure? ah! where thy bloom? thy gait
So graceful, where? What lives of her, of her
Who once breathed love, whose every trait
Me frorn my very sels could stir,

Loved after Cinara, thy fame once rife
For charrn and winsome ways? But Fate could give
To Cinara few years of life,
While planning Lyce long should live

To be the ancient raven’s peer in age,
That youthfui sparks, whom now their passions scorch,
May see, while smiles their mirth praeage,
The smoldering ashes of thy torch.
