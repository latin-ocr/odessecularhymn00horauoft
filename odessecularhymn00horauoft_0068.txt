THE ODES OF HORACE

XXXV

To Fortuna

GODDESS, queen of Antium fair,
Strong to exalt from low estate
Our mortal clay, and prompt to bear
Funereal gloom mid triumphs great:

The needy hind his anxious vow
Prefers to thee, to thee they kneel

As ocean's mistress, they who plow
Carpathian waves with Thynian keel.

Thee Dacians rude, sseet Scythian bands,
Towns, tribes, and martial Rome obey‚
Mothers of kings of Eastern {ands
And purple despots own thy sway‚

Lest with thy foot in wanton might
The standing pillar thou o'erwhelm,

Lest mobs urge on each laggard wight
To arms, to arms, and sink the realm.

Before thee walks with sullen tread
Necessity‚ whose brazen grasp

Holds wedge and spikes‚ while molten lead
ls wanting not, nor rigid hasp.

Rare Faith, in shining raiment clothed,
And Hope love thee, and fondly cleave

Tho' thou enraged, in vestments loathed‚
Of stately dwellings take thy leave.

But veering herd and perjured trull

Sneak back: when with its lees each jar
ls emptied, friendship's oaths are null

As false companions scatter far.
