The Beauty of Glycera .

ΗΕ son of Theban Semele,
The ruthless mother of the Loves, and she
Called frolic Wantonness, implore
My heart to seek forgotten flames once rnore.

1 burn for Glycera, beauteous lass,

Whose dazzling charms the Parian stone surpass,

l burn to see each saucy grace,
The gramarye of that too-seductive face.

Venus o'erwhelms me with her might,
Quits Cyprus, and forbids me sing the sight
By Parthians waged from ssying steeds,
The Scythian troops, or aught but lovers' deeds.

Here bring live turf, fresh greenery here,
Burn incense, boys, and wine of yaeteryaer,

Spilled frorn the basin, earth shall stain:
ln kindlier mood she comes, a victim slain.
