ΙΙ

To Iulus Antonius

HOEVER seeks with Pindar to contend,
On wax-knit pinions of Daedalian frame
He soars. Iulus, surely doomed to lend
Some hyaline sea his name.

As, from the hius, a stream in headiong ssight,
Surcharged with rains, o'erflows its wonted shores,
So, with deep utterance and sonorous might,
Great Pindar seethae and roars.

Worthy that Phoebus' bay by him be worn,
Whether thro* daring dithyrambs he weave
His new-coined words and, by his numbers borne.
All rule discard and leave;

Whether he sing of gods or monarchs bred
From gods, thro’ whom succumbed the Centaurs dire
To death deserved, thro’ whom succumbed the dread
Chimera, spewing sire:

Whether he hymn the boxer and the steed
Whom palms of Elis to the skiae uplift,
Who hold a hundred statu& poorer meed
Than is the poet's gift;

Or mourn the stripling torn from tearful bride,
And raise amid the stars his golden worth,
His strength, his metue, grudging laet they bide

Beneath the gloomy earth.

The swan of Dirce by the breezae free
Was borne, Antonius, when sublime he rode
Amid the clouds: Ι, like the Matine bee,
In manner and in mode.
