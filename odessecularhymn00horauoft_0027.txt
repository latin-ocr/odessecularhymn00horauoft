To Maecenas

AECENAS, sprung from forbears who were kings.
Both pride and prop to which my fortune clings,
Some like to see Olympic dust uproll
When smoking axles deftly graze the g0a1‚
While victor car and palm of noble worth
Exalt among the gods the lords of earth.
This joys if the Quirites’ sickle crowd
Promote his rule to triple honors proud.
That takes delight if in his barn he store
The product of the Lybian throehing ssoor.
Who loves to hoe his small ancestral field,
Not all the wealth an Attalus could yield
Can tempt the sailor's fearful life to brave,
And shear with Cyprian prowjhe Myrtoan wave.
The trader, dreading rough Icarian seas
Lashed by the west, extols his rural ease
And village calm, but soon, as ill he bears
His straitened means, his shattered ships repairs.
Some crave old Massic's rare convivial powers
And blocks of leisure cut from business hours,
Stretched now where arbutae green their shadows fling.
Now near some hallowed river's bubbling spring.
Some love the rningled horns' and trumpets’ bray,
The dutias of the camp, and battled fray
Abhorred by mothers. ’Neath Jove’s nipping skies,
Heedlaes of gentle wife, the huntsman hies
Where’er his trusty hounds the deer beset,
Or Marsian boar bursts thro* the twisted net.
Me ivy, the reward of cultured brows‚
