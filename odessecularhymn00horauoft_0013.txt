To HORACE

EAR was the nook where pines and poplars blend
Their branchos, dear the nard and blossoms gay

And Cinara’s kindly presence. dear the play.

The mellow cups, and care-free hours they lend:
Dearer to thee the uplifts that attend

The moral reign of law, and dearest they,

Men who were half thy soul‚ thy prop and stay,
Who, greatest of their time, could call thee Friend.
So while spring ssowerets clothe the unfettered plain,

While summer's shaded brooks cool plow-worn steers,

And fruitful autumn’s harvests broadcast lle,
While winter locks the streams and whips the main,
Thro’ the long lapse of immemorial years
Thy fame shall spread: thou shalt not wholly die.
