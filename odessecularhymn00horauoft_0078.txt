54 THE ODES 01³ HORACE

,Iuno and AfrIc's friendly train,
Who weakly left unvenged its coast,
Have now the victors’ grandsons slain
And pacified Jugurtha's ghost.

What plain, enriched with Latin gore,
But by its barrows well recalls

Curst frays that to Hesperia bore
Α downfall heard in Medic halls?

’ Our wretched wars are rumored wide.
What river knows them not? what ssood?
What sea has Daunian rage not dyed?
What shore is guiltless of our blood?

Pert Muse, sweet themes abandon not:
For thee no dirge of Ceos moans;

With me, beneath Dione's grot‚
Attune thy lyre to lighter tones.
