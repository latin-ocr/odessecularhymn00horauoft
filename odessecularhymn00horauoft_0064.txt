40 THE ODES OF HORACE

xxxl

My Prayer to Apollo

HAT from enshrIned Apollo may
His poet ask? For what, while drops
Wine from his chance, shall he pray?
Not blest Sardinia’s teeming crops,

Nor parched Calabria's goodly kine,
Not lndian ivory and gold,

Nor meads where Liris' still streams twine
And silently wear down the mold.

Let Cales’ favored sons produce

The grape. that some rich lord of trade
May drain from golden cups the juice

For which his Syrian wares have paid—

The gods’ own charge, since more than thrice
He yearly sails the Atlantic seas
Unscathed: me olives will suffice.
Me endive and light mallows please.

Grant me, l pray, Latona’s son,

A mind undimmed, a healthy frame,
Contentment with possessions won,

A tuneful age. and spotless name.
