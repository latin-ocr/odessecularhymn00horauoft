102 THE ODES OF HORACE

xll

Neobule's Soliloquy

APLESS the maidens to whom are forbidden
Love and the winecup, but ever are chidden
By uncles whose tongues sting like lashesl

See, Neobule, how Cypris’ boy, Cupid,
Steals web and wool basket; weaving is stupid
Since fair to thy sight Hebrus ssashael

Swims he in Tiber and far gleams his shoulder‚
Rides like Bellerophon, no one is bolder
At boxing, none sseeter in running:

Deit to spear stags mid the startled herd flying‚
And to rouse boars in the dense thicket lying
None can approach him in cunning.
