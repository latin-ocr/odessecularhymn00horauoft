ιχ
To Thaliarchus

ΕΕ how Soracte's jutting crown
Looms white and deep with drifted snow:
lce sags the laboring foraets down:
· Keen frost arraets the rivers' ssOW.

Haep high the hearth with {ogs to bar
The coldness out and, Thaliarch, pour
From out the twy-eared Sabine jar
The mellower wine of seasons four.

Leave all with God: tho· first he lash
γ Tm yeasty saes with battling shock,
He lays his winds, and aged ash

And cypraes tree no longer rock.

Seek not to-rnorrow's hap to learn.
Each shift of fortune count for gain.

And, while a you'ngster. neither spurn
Nor sweets of love nor choral train

While hoary Age with taety air

Shuns thy green youth: in park and bower
With whispered words accost the fair

By twilight at the trysting hour:

Espy, concealed in secret nook‚
The laughing maiden. nearly mi§ed‚
Who yields. while seigning angry ¹ook‚
The forfeit snatched from hand or wrist.
