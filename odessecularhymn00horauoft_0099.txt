BOOK Two

Daetined bourn more sure and speedy
Ne'er awaits thee, wealthy lord,

Than the halls of Orcus greedy.
Why strive further? ’Neath the sward

Opae the realm of prince and pauper,
Nor could sly Prometheus' gold
Bribe the unrelenting torpor
Of Dis· boatman. He can hold

Both Tantalidos and vainful
Tantalus: he freae from woe

Hinds dismissed from labors painful.
whether he be called or no.
