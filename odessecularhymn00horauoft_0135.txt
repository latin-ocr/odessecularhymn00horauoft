To Pyrrhus

YRRHUS, how great the risk canst thou not see.
Who from Gaetulian lionaes hast sought
Her cubs? Soon. timorous robber. shalt thou flee
Τὴε doughty battle fought,

When thro' the youths that jostle o'er the field
Nearchus fair she seeks to steal away:
A mighty conflict. whose result must yield
To thee or her the preyl

When ’gainst the string thy whizzing shafts are put,
And while she whets her teeth to do thee harm.

Tne arbiter of fight his naked foot
Has set upon the palm,

'Tis rumored, while, by gentle breezes lapt,
His scented traesae wanton o'er his broest.
As Nireus fair, or he who erst was rapt
From lda's fountained ςγδι.
