98 THE ODES OF HORACE

IX

The Reconciliation ΚΞ

He HILE l in thee affection stirred,
And round thy snowy neck no youth preferred
Was ever wont his arms to ssing‚
1 flourished wealthier than the Persians’ king.

She While for none else thou more hast burned,
And Lydia was not yet for Chloe spurned,
1, Lydia, of illustrious name,
Flourished more fair than Roman llia’s fame.

He Me now the Thracian Chloe sways.
Α mistress of the lute, soft strains she plays,
E’en death for her 1 fain would meet
lf kindly Fate will only spare my sweet.

She Me Calais burns with mutual fire—
From Thurii he and Ornytus his sire—

For him l twice would die, in sooth.

lf kindly Fate will only spare my youth.

He What if old love again shall reign,
And bind with brazen bonds us parted twain‚
lf ssaxen Chloe be denied,
And jilted Lydia see the door ope wide?

She Tho’ fairer he than any star,
Tho' lighter thou than eorl< and wilder far
Than is the stormy Hadrian wave,
With thee Ι fain would live, would seek the grave.
