THE ODES OF HORACE

XXIX

To Iccius

INCE, Iccius, Arab wealth has held
Thy fancy, wouldst thou fight indeed

Sabaean kings. as yet unquened,
And bind with chains the frightful Mede?

Who of the fair barbarian girls,
Her ¹over stain, will be thy thrall?
What page from court with scented curls
Wilt thou to bear thy cup install —

A youth who from his father's bow
Shoots Seric shafts? Who now denies

That Tiber's ssood may backward ssow,
Back to their hills that streams may rise, .

Since thou Panaetius' tomes wilt trade,
Ay. and the whole Socratic school.
For steely corselets Spanish-made?
1 thought thy brain knew wiser rule!
