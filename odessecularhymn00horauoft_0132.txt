THE ODES OF HORACE

xvii
To Aelius Lamia

ELIUS. from ancient Lamus sprung

Most nobly-for from him arose
Lamiae of days both old and young,
As written record clearly shows -

He who was founder of thy stem
Held Formiae's walls and ruled, they say,
Where Liris' brimming waters hem
Marica’s shores, lord of wide sway.

To-morrow eastern winds will roar.

Shake down thick leaves in eddying ssight,
And strew with useless kelp the shore,

lf rain’s old seer foretold aright,

The crow. While skies are warm, heap up
Dry logs. Thy soul to·m0rrow please
With suckling pig and cheering cup,
And with thy slaves enjoy thine ease.
