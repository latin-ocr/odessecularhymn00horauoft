120 THE ODES OF HORACE

XXVII

To Galatea

ΕΤ pregnant bitch, the owl with omened cry,
The vixen lately whelped, or she-wolf dun
That lopes from fields that fringe Lanuvium high,
Pursue the godless one:

Let snakes that scare his ponies quickly end
His Journey at its outset‚ when athwart
His road they dart like arrows; for my friend>
1, like a seer well-taught,

Before the prophet of impending rain
Reseeks his stagnant marshes, will invoke
From out the dawning east, good luel< to gain.
The raven’s raucous croak.

God speed thee, and where'er thy steps incline
Still keep my image, Galatea, at heart;
No flitting crow or woodpecker malign
Forbids thee to depart.

But see, Orion hastes with prone career
Mid gathering storms: for me, 1 know too well
Dari< Hadria's bight and how, tho‘ skies be clear.
Iapyx churns the swell.

Let none but wives and children of our foes
Know the blind rage of Auster’s rising blast,
And roar of glowering surge whose buffet blows
’Gainst quivering reefs are massed.

So, too, Europa to the wily bull
Consigned her snowy form, but as she sailed
Thro' monstrous tide and ocean dangerful,
Brave tho' she was, she paled.
