BOOK THREE 99

To Lyce

HO'. Lyce. wont to quaff far Tanais' river,
Some brute thy sponse, before thy cruel door
Stretched out at length, thou wouldst not bid me shiver
While native northers roar.

Haeraet thou not the creaking of the gateway,
The howl of blasts that bend thy courtyard trees?
Jove's claer, crisp air grows sharper now and straightway
Τὴε drifted snow will freeze.

Since Venus frowns on pride, be not disdainful,
Laet back slip wheel and rope together gaered2
Thee no Penelope, to suitors baneful,
Thy Tyrrhene father reared.

Tho’ sallow huae on cheeks of lovers written
Unbend thee not at all, nor gift, nor prayer,
Nor yet thy man by frail Pierian smitten—
Prithee, thy votariae spare,

Thou, not more pliant than the oak tree knurly,
L&- mild of mood than Mauretaniam snake;
Low on thy doorsill mid the tempests surly
My side not aye will ache.
