BOOK ONE

Guard Caesar, who will soon have steered
For Britain, at the globe's far rim,
And guard our youthful levi& feared
ln Red sea lands and Orient dim.

Alas, the shame of civil strife,
lts scars, its crimes! Our hardened age
What vice avoids? Our impious life
Leaves what unsunied? Doae our rage

Fear gods themselves no more? What fane
Is spared? On anvil forge anew

Our blunted sword whose lethal bane
Arab and Massagete may rue.
