BOOK Two 63

Χ
To Licinius

lClNIUS, that thy life be safelier led,
Steer not too boldly for the open main,
Nor hug too closely treacherous shorae, thro· dread
Of stormwinds' blatant reign.

what man soever loves the golden mean
Safely avoids a squam, tottering cell,
Sanely avoids the proud palatia! scene
Where Envy's minions dwell.

More oft it is the hugaet pine that creaks
When winds are wild, with weightier tuin crash
The toploes towers, and on the mountain peaks
Daecends the levin flash.

The mind well schooled when days are bright will sear,
When days are dark will hope for, fortune's shift,
For Jove. who brings the wintry tempests drear,
will likewise make them lift

And vanish. Tho· our lot be ill to-day,
lt ἀυτῶ not ever: oft with harpings low

Apollo wakae the Muse, and not for aye
He bends his angry bow.

ln times of εἴτε-55 approve thyself a man
Both brave and patient: but when spanking gales
Τοο freely blow around thee, wisely plan
To reef thy bellying sails.
