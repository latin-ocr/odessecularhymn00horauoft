To Venus

HO'. Venus. long is hushed the fray,
wilt thou revive it? Spare me, spare, l prayl
Not now, as once, my youthful glow‚
When thralled by kindly Cinara. Forego,

The sweet boves mother. stern of brow,
Urging a man nigh fifty, callous now

Toward lurae, to list thy mandates: flee
Where suasive prayers of striplings call sor thee.

With revel haste, 'twere better far.

⁷ Borne by thy purple swans on rapid car,

where Paulus Maximus abides
lf quaeting heart more meet for passion's tides.

Handsome is he, of birth the best,
Prompt pleader when defendants stand distrest,

Α youth accomplished past compare.
Who far the banne-rs of thy war shall bear.

He, with a smne, shall soon behold

His worth outweigh some lavish rival's gold,
And, grateful, by the Alban mere,

'Neath cedam roof thy marble bust shall rear.

There fragrant scents shalt thou Inhale,
Thy ravished ear shall hearken to the wail
Of syrinx wedded to the late,
Nor shall the Berecyntlan pipe be mute.
