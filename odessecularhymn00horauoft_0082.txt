58 THE ODES OF HORACE

v
To α Friend

OT yet her subject neck may wear
The yoke‚ not yet may she fulffll
The duties of a mate, or bear
The amorous bull's impetuous will.

ln verdant meads at will to graze
Absorbs thy heifer's tranquil mind,
The heat of summer she allays
In streams, and seeks her yearling kind

ln willow copsoe wet. Ne'er yearn
For unripe grapes: with garish reign
Comes crimson autumn, soon to turn
Each darkening bunch to purpler stain.

Soon she will come: time’s mad career
Draws years from thee to give to her:
Soon boldly‚ when she needs a fere,
For thee will Lalage bestir.

For her shalt thou more deeply pine
Than erst for bashful Pholoe,

Or Chloris, she whose shoulders shine
Like moonbeams on the nightly sea,

Or Cnidian Gygae—scaroe is read

His sex when mid the bevied girls.
And strangers well may be misled

By blooming cheeks and flowing curls.
