xii PREFACE

rarely‚ while a few others are, so far as 1 know, now pre-
sented for the first time. The selection of suitable stanzas
is a puzzling matter and difficulties are sure to attend any
decision. A strophe-for-strophe version, like the present, is
a veritable bed of Procrustes, and in such it is perhaps hu-
manly impossible to attain the ideal of translation, which
has been said to be “the original, the whole original, and
nothing but the original, and, withal, good readable Eng-
lish.'' The man of ordinary attainments will be compelled
sometimes to curtail and sometimes to expand the original,
and fortunate indeed will he be if he does not occasionally
find himself confronted by insuperable difficulties in the
handling of his mother—tongue.

The thirty-seven Alcaics (the odes agreeing in structure
with i, 9) have been put into alternately riming iambic
tetrameter, a meter which has come to be looked upon as
the English measure best suited to this stanza. lt offers a
rapid and mobile, yet dignified, vehicle of expression, and it
has generally been possible to compress the forty-one syllables
of Latin into thirty-two syllables of English without doing
great injustice to either tongue.

The twenty-six Sapphic poems (odes metrically like i, 2)
l have put into stanzas consisting of three iambic pen-
tameters and one iambic trimeter, disposing the rimae
alternately. This selection cannot but be considered as
unfortunate, for the superior brevity of our tongue here
becomes readily manifest when the compass of thirty-six
syllables of English is used to translate thirty-eight syl-
lables of Latin. ln not a few odae 1 have been painfully
conscious of having to use more “padding'’ than 1 could
desire, yet, on the other hand, when 1 tried to use a stanza
each verse of which was a foot shorter. l found that it neces-
sitated a curtailment still more to be condemned.

The twelve odes known as the Second Asclepiads (the
type of which i, 3 is an instance) have been put into con·
secutively riming iambic tetrameters and pentameters.
following the metrica! scheme used in one of these odes three
centuries ago by Ben Jonson.

The nine Third Asclepiads (odes after the pattern of i, 6)
