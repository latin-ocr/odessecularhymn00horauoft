ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE

XIX

I n Honor os Muraena

ROM Inachus how long the tide
To Codrus, who for country bravely died,
What sons had Aeacus, how great
The wars ’neath sacred Troy, thou canst relate:

But when from this Paelignian cold
Ι shall be free, where best our revel hold,
The eost of Chian by the cask‚
Or who will heat our lymph, 'twere vain to ask!

Quick, boy, a mast, “New Moon’' the word, -

Next,‘ ‘Midnightx' and* ‘Muraena augurl third,
And let our brimmIng cups of wine
Be mixed, as suits us best, three parts or nine.

The Muses odd in number, see

Their frenzied poet call for three times three,
But more than three the sister train

Of naked Gracae grant not, lest the stain

Of tipsy brawling mar our feast.

Nay, madly will l rollick. Why are ceased
The notes of Berecyntian flute?

Why hangs the pipe beside the silent lute?

l hate skimped hands! Heaped roses strowl
Our antic mirth let envious Lycus know,

And let her hear, our neighbor sweet,
Α match for oldster Lycus all unmeet.

To thee with clustering ringlets gay

And, Telephus, more bright than Vesper's ray,
Mature for wedlock, Rhode turns:

For Glycera my bosom slowly burns.
