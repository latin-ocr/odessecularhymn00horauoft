THE ODES OF HORACE

XVI

A Palinode

FAIRER than thy mother fair,
Let naught my scurril epodes save:
Either to burn them be thy care,
Or cast them in the Hadrian wave.

Not he whose Pythian priestess pants¹
Or Dindymene mazes so,
Not Liber thus, or Corybants,
Who clash shrill cymbals blow on blow‚

As gusts of anger: Noric brand,
Nor cruel fire, nor wrecking seas‚
Nor Jove himself with thundering hand
Descending‚ e'er suppresses these.

Prometheus for our prima! clay
Some trait from every creature drew, N
And hence, ’tis said, the madding sway
Of lions in our bosoms grew.

'Twas anger struck Thyestes down

With frightful d00m; such, too, the source
Of wrack to many a lofty town

Whose haughty enemy could force

The hostile plowshare thro’ their walls.
Calm, then, thy mind: my frenzied fire

Of restive youth both frequent brawls
And swift iambics could inspire.

More cordially 1 now would act:

Wrath shall supplant good will no more:
My biting insults 1 retract—

So be my friend, thy love restore.
