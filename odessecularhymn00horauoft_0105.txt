On Contentment

ΗΑΤΕ you1 hence. unhallowed throngsl
Be hushed! the Muses· priest, 1 bring,
ΤίΙΙ now unheard, a sheaf of songs;
To maidens and to youths l sing.

Kings o’er their ssoclss exert their sway.
Yet kings- thernselvae hold Jove in awe:
A conqueror in the Giant fray,
His nod is nature's steadfast law.

This man plants vines in ampler rows;
That‚ seeking office, trusts to birth

When down upon the Field he goae;
Α third takes pride in manly worth;

ln client throngs a fourth finds farne:
Yet equitable Fate in turn

Doorns great and smalh and every name
Is shaken in the spacious urn.

Siciflian catae give no sweet zaet
¹ To jaded taste, while notes of harp
And birds will ne'er to him bring raet
Above whose impious neck a sharp

Drawn saber hangs; but gentle sleep
Shuns not the cabin of the hind,

Nor marge embowered in boskage deep,
Nor Tempe fanned by zephyrs kind.
