MAIDEN, guardian of the grove and hin,
Thtice called, thou hearaet in her travail pain

The youthfu1 wife and wardaet death at will,
Goddaes of threefold reign.

Thine be the pine that shadae my country seat,
And on it every year wil! 1 baetow.
With gladsome heart, the blood of tusker sseet
‘sbat daels the sidelong blow.
