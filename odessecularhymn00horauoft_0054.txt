ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE

xxu
To Fuscus

HE man of upright life and conduct clean

Needs neither Moorlsh javelin nor bow,

Nor quiver, Fuscus, stuffed with arrows keen
Whose tips with poison flow,

Across the sultry Syrtes tho' he fare,
Or thro’ those distant lands where slowly wends
Hydaspes' stream, in story famed, or ‘where
Bleak Caucasus ascends.

For, singing Lalage, as late 1 led
My truant footsteps thro’ the Sabine wood‚
Devoid of care, l rnet a wolf that ssed,
Unarmed altho' Ι stood:

A monster such as never yet appeared
Where warlike Daunia's oak woods wide expand,
Nor such the nurse of lions yet has reared —
King Juba's arid land.

Tho’ Ι be placed among those barren plains
Where summer airs awake no tree to life,
That quarter of the world where winter reigns‚

And sog and sleet are rife;

Tho’ l be placed in houseless elimes that burn,

Where day's bright chariot glows with tropic heat.
Yet ever Ι for Lalage will yearn,

Sweet smiling, prattling sweet.
