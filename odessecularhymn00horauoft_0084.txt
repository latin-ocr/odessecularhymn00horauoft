THE ODES OF HORACE

Vll

To Pompey

ΟΠ with me in gravoet plights
When Brutus led his hosts of yore,
Who now, restored to civic rights,
Recalls thee to thy native shore

And home-gods, Pompey, friend the bost,
With whom with wine 1 used to sseet
The lagging days, my wreathed locks drffit

With far Assyria’s ointments sweet?

With thee in panic Ι forsook
¹ Philippi, where, as recreant must, ξ

Ι left my targe, while Valor shook ⁸
And warriors basely bit the dust.

Me in my terror Mercury swift .·
Wrapt in thick cloud and saved from foe& ζ’

Thee ressuent tides again bade drift ’-
Amid war’s billows' boisterous blows.

Come, spread for Jove the banquet due:
Stretch out beneath my laurei tree
Those limbs with warfare wearied thro',

Nor spare the casks reserved for thee.

Since Massic every care dispels,
Fill burnished beakers to the brim,
Pour unguents from the generous shelis;
From supple parsley, myrtle limb,

Quick, who will plait the wreaths? whom, pray‚
As iord of cups will Venus send?

Sweet is Edonian mirth: 'tis gay.
This tippiing with a long-lost friend.
