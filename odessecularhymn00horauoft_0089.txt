To Maecenas

UMANTIA'S tedious wars, where hosts were pitted.
Stern Hannibal, and wide Sicilia’s main
With Punic gore empurpled, are unfitted
For gentle lyric strain.

Fell Lapiths and Hylaeus drunk and baetial
Suit not my song, nor, by Alcides quelled,
The sons of Earth who shook the domes celestial
Of >Saturn hoar with eld

From cope to base. Do thou, Maecenas, rather
Narrate our Caesar's wars in ordered prose,
And tell of streets where shackled monarchs gather,
Our late intrepid foes.

To me the Muse commends Licymnia’s singing,
Thy lady's dulcet voice, and bids me praise
Her sparkling eyes and, fror'n her heart upspringing,
Her faithful, loving ways.

None sprightlier show, no lighter foot advancae
Mid choral bands, nor whiter arms entwine
With fair-garbed virgins in the faetal dancae
On Dian’s day divine.

Wouldst take for one of dear Licymnia·s traces
The wealth of Mygdon, fertile Phrygia's king,
What coffered store Achaemenes possessos,
Or Araby can bring,

When yields the loved one to thy burning kisses,
Or when withholds her sweets‚ unkindly coy,
Yet hopae them rapt by force, or when the blissae

Snatchae herself in joy?
