134 THE ODES ΟΡ HORACE

That culls with patient toil the savory thyme
Thro' humid Tibur's dells and woodlands fair,
Α humble poet, mold my lowly rime
By dint of utmost care.

Thyself shalt sing, a bard of loftier song,
Augustus crowned with bay, his well-earned due,
When up the Sacred Slope he hales along
The fierce Sygambrian crew:

Caesar, than whom no greater, better thing
The Fates and kindly gods have given to men,
Nor shall they give, tho' sseeting centuriae bring
The Golden Age again.

Thyself shalt sing the city’s festal joys
And gala days, the public contests stern,
And Forum, freed awhile from lawsuits’ noise
At Caesar's wished return.

lf worthy to be heard my songs appear,
My tongue's best powers with thine will join: “O day
Most fair, be honored long‚'' with Caesar here
Enraptured l shall say.

Then as thy car, O triumph, passes by,
We citizens, not once alone, shall skirl
“Ho Triumph,” while to gracious gods on high
Shall spicy fumes upcurl.

Ten goodly bullocks and as many cows
Shall quite absolve thee while a tender calf,
That, lately weaned, on lush grass loves to browse,
Shall die in my behalf.

As shines the crescent moon when three days old,
So gleam the horns arising from its head;
Α spot it carries snowy to behold,
Tho’ elsewhere dusky red.
