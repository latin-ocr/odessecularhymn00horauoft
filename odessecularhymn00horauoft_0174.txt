150 THE ODES OF HORACE

><11
To V irgil

-OW spring‘s attendants, Thracian gales, assuaging
The ruffled seas, on bulging canvas blow.
No meads are frost-bound nor are torrents raging,
Turgid with winter's snow.

She who, foul stain of Cecrops* house, dared follow
The barbarous monarch's lust with doom unb1aet.
Bemoaning ltys' loss, the ill-started swallow,
1s building now her nest.

Stretched on soft turf the shepherd pipes a measure,
Watching his fatling fold his fise he thrills,
And charms that god to whom the herds give pleasure
And Arcady's dark hills.

Thirst comes, O Virgil, with this warmer weather‚ ,
But if Calenian vintagelthou wouldst try,
Tho' oft the guest where riobles dine together,
Now nard thy drinks must buy.

Nard in a tiny box os· alabaster
Will coax a ssagon from Sulpiciam vaults
Replete with freshest hopes and strong to master
Care's bitterest assaults.

Bestir thee, come, if for such joyance eager‚
And bring the price: scot-free 1 do not mean
To steep thee in my cups, for wealth but meager
Within my home is seen.

Make thy delays and greed submit to reason.
Heed death's black pyres, and mingle, while 'tis meet.
Flashes of fun with wisdom, for in season‘
To play the fool is sweet.
